Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.The new vaccine was developed by a Mater Research team based at The Translational Research Institute in collaboration with The University of Queensland. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.Lead Researcher Associate Professor Kristen Radford says the vaccine has the potential to treat a variety of blood cancers and malignancies and is a major breakthrough for cancer vaccinations. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.We are hoping this vaccine could be used to treat blood cancers, such as myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and paediatric leukaemias, plus solid malignancies including breast, lung, renal, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, and glioblastoma," she said. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.Our new vaccine is comprised of human antibodies fused with tumour-specific protein, and we are investigating its capacity to target human cells while activating the memory of the tumour cells. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.Associate Professor Radford says the vaccine offers several key advantages over existing cancer vaccines, which have already shown promise in early clinical trials. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.First, it can be produced as an 'off the shelf' clinical grade formulation, which circumvents the financial and logistical issues associated with patient-specific vaccines," she said. Scientists are ready to trial a new cancer vaccine in humans following the successful outcome of their preclinical studies.Secondly, this prototype vaccine targets the key tumour cells required for the initiation of tumour-specific immune responses, thereby maximising potential effectiveness of treatment, while minimising potential side effects.
