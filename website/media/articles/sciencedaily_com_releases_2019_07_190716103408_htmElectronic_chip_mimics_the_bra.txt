When tiny energy spikes reach a certain threshold of voltage, the neurons bind together -- and you've started creating a memory. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.On the chip, light is used to generate a photocurrent. Switching between colors causes the current to reverse direction from positive to negative. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.This direction switch, or polarity shift, is equivalent to the binding and breaking of neural connections, a mechanism that enables neurons to connect (and induce learning) or inhibit (and induce forgetting). Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.This is akin to optogenetics, where light-induced modification of neurons causes them to either turn on or off, enabling or inhibiting connections to the next neuron in the chain. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.To develop the technology, the researchers used a material called black phosphorus (BP) that can be inherently defective in nature. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.This is usually a problem for optoelectronics, but with precision engineering the researchers were able to harness the defects to create new functionality. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.Defects are usually looked on as something to be avoided, but here we're using them to create something novel and useful," Ahmed said. Researchers from RMIT University drew inspiration from an emerging tool in biotechnology -- optogenetics -- to develop a device that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.It's a creative approach to finding solutions for the technical challenges we face.
