Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found promising results in their search for a treatment to stop nerve cell degeneration that happens in some types of disorders, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia and Parkinson's disease, which can cause significant disability.The UIC research, published in the clinical neurology and translational neuroscience journal Brain, was led by Xue-Jun Li, the Michael A. Werckle Professor of biomedical sciences at the College of Medicine Rockford. Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found promising results in their search for a treatment to stop nerve cell degeneration that happens in some types of disorders, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia and Parkinson's disease, which can cause significant disability.The study looked at how the long axons that carry messages between nerve cells in the brain can break down, which causes increasingly worse tightening of the leg muscles, leading to imbalance and eventually paralysis, in addition to other symptoms.

"We then looked at whether a particular agent would change the way the nerve cells function -- and it did. It inhibited the mitochondrial fission and let the nerve cells grow normally and also stopped further damage.

The researchers also suggest that using gene therapy could prevent mitochondrial damage, providing another strategy to reverse the nerve damage.
