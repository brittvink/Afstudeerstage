The Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) study began in 1989 with a health survey that was sent to all women aged 47-56 living in the Kuopio region, eastern Finland. A total of 14,200 women received the survey, and it has been repeated at five-year intervals. In addition, a randomised sample of 3,000 women have participated in bone mineral density measurements every five years. The study is still ongoing, with 30-year measurements currently under way. Published in Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, the present findings are from the 25-year follow-up. The study included all OSTPRE study participants who had participated in all of the bone mineral density measurements during the 25-year follow-up. The average decrease in bone mineral density was lower than has been assumed on the basis of earlier, shorter follow-ups where the bone loss rate at the femoral neck has been estimated to be even more than 20%. There were also surprisingly few risk factors affecting bone mineral density. The most significant factor protecting against bone loss was hormone replacement therapy. Weight gain during the follow-up also protected against bone loss," Associate Professor Joonas Sirola from the University of Eastern Finland says. This new, long-term follow-up of bone mineral density sheds significant new light on osteoporosis and bone research, and also changes our understanding of bone loss in older women," Professor Heikki Kr√∂ger from the University of Eastern Finland says.
