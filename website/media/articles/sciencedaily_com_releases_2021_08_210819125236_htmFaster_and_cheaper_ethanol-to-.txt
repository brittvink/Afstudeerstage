The new PNNL-patented catalyst converts biofuel (ethanol) directly into a versatile "platform" chemical called n-butene. A microchannel reactor design further reduces costs while delivering a scalable modular processing system.

Currently, n-butene is produced from fossil-based feedstocks using the energy-intensive cracking -- or breaking down -- of large molecules. The new technology reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by using renewable or recycled carbon feedstocks. Using sustainably derived n-butene as a starting point, existing processes can further refine the chemical for multiple commercial uses, including diesel and jet fuels, and industrial lubricants.
