White lab coats and dangerous experiments all epitomise the 'mad scientist' from many a Hollywood blockbuster but, even beyond the silver screen, the stereotype lives on, and according to new research, it could mar the next generation of potential scientists.Conducted by the University of South Australia and the Australian Catholic University, the new research shows how gender stereotypes influence young people's perceptions of scientists, with findings showing that despite enjoying science, few children are interested in pursuing it as a career.

In the case of science, media often shows scientists to be eccentric men in white coats," Dr Stahl says.

Children were asked about the job they'd like when they grew up; whether they'd like to be a scientist; what kind of work a scientist did; and what a scientist might look like.

Nearly 40 per cent of students said they 'did not like' science, and that it was 'boring' or 'weird'.
