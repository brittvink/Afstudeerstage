In a 3-meter diameter hollow aluminum sphere, Cary Forest, a University of Wisconsin-Madison physics professor, is stirring and heating plasmas to 500,000 degrees Fahrenheit to experimentally mimic the magnetic field-inducing cosmic dynamos at the heart of planets, stars and other celestial bodies.Over a period of about two years, "the sun's magnetic field switches directions, and we know that because the polarity of the sunspots changes," explains Forest, an expert on cosmic dynamos and the magnetic fields they generate in planets, stars and other objects. "Sunspots are just magnetic fields emerging from the sun. They are the diagnostic feature of what's happening deep inside the sun.

Those surging fields generate sunspots, which can sometimes erupt and release vast amounts of energy in the form of solar flares or hiccups of material known as coronal mass ejections.

"The sun has an AC rather than a DC dynamo," says Forest.

There are few sunspots and no massive storms to speak of, says Forest. But the Wisconsin physicist also notes that last year, when solar max was just getting underway, proved to be a great year for auroras, the colorful curtains, bands and streamers of light observed near the poles of Earth caused by the charged particles from the solar wind colliding with atoms high in the atmosphere.

"Last year's display was really good.

"Every couple of hundred years, there is a major solar flare," Forest says, "and that sends a pulse capable of doing some serious stuff on Earth.

The event spawned a geomagnetic storm that caused telegraph systems in Europe and North America to fail, throwing sparks from pylons and even giving some telegraph operators shocks. In 1989, a massive geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection during solar max, sparked the collapse of the electrical transmission system in Quebec.

From our sun, he adds, "superflares would likely cause serious problems, disrupting power grids satellites and other system we depend on.
