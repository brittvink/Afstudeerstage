If you can't stop saying or doing things that you later regret, here's a diagnostic test for you: Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have pioneered a way to better determine when acting on one's worst impulses verges on pathological.Turns out, acting more recklessly when your emotions run high can be correlated with how fast you react to stimulating visuals, especially disturbing ones, according to the findings recently published in the online edition of the journal Brain and Neuroscience Advances.

If you can't stop saying or doing things that you later regret, here's a diagnostic test for you: Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have pioneered a way to better determine when acting on one's worst impulses verges on pathological.This new measure is exciting because it provides a more objective way to assess negative urgency, which predicts mental problems," said study co-lead author Sheri Johnson, a UC Berkeley professor of psychology. If you can't stop saying or doing things that you later regret, here's a diagnostic test for you: Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have pioneered a way to better determine when acting on one's worst impulses verges on pathological.The emotional stop-signal task was carried out by 450 study participants, including 150 psychiatric patients. They viewed on a computer screen a mix of comforting and disturbing photographs, such as children playing with kittens and an emaciated famine victim, then rated each picture by hitting either a "positive" or "negative" button.

Those whose self-assessment signaled poor impulse control were so fast on the trigger that they frequently reacted to the photo even before the stop sign appeared.

This is significant because, in a worst-case scenario, negative emotion-related impulsivity can lead to extreme behaviors like self-harm and suicide," said study co-lead author J.D. Allen, a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley and a researcher at Oberlin College and Conservatory in Ohio.

And, it can be challenging to determine when poor impulse control is age-appropriate and healthy versus a possible sign of mental illness, especially among young children.

"But if a person can't stop crying once they start, or throws tantrums and gets aggressive, this may be a warning sign of underlying vulnerability to psychiatric problems and accompanying behavioral issues.

They filled out the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale to rate themselves on negative and positive urgency. Next, they viewed a fast-moving series of photos on a computer screen and categorized each image as either positive or negative.

Their results remained consistent, indicating the stability of the test protocol.

They also would like to see the evaluation eventually used in schools to catch potential psychiatric disorders early.
