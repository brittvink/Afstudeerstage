High doses of some traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are associated with similar cardiovascular risks as the new generation of anti-inflammatory drugs known as COX 2 inhibitors (like Vioxx ®), finds a study in this week's British Medical Journal.Researchers from the UK and Italy performed a combined analysis (known as a "meta-analysis") of all the available randomised trials that compared a COX 2 inhibitor with placebo, or a COX 2 inhibitor with a traditional NSAID, and had recorded serious cardiovascular events. By including data from 138 trials among 140,000 patients, this meta-analysis provides a much more reliable estimate of the cardiovascular risks of these drugs, since individual trials were too small to study this question. High doses of some traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are associated with similar cardiovascular risks as the new generation of anti-inflammatory drugs known as COX 2 inhibitors (like Vioxx ®), finds a study in this week's British Medical Journal.The study showed, as expected, that, COX 2 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of vascular events, mainly heart attack. Unfortunately, there were insufficient data to reliably assess whether these risks were dose dependent, or whether the risks might differ among aspirin and non-aspirin users.
