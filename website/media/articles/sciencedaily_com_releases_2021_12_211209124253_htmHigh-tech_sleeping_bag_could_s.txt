A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.New research published in JAMA Ophthalmology shows that by suctioning these fluids and unloading brain pressure, the specially designed sleeping bag may prevent vision problems astronauts endure in space, where fluids float into the head and continually push and reshape the back of the eyeball. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.The phenomenon has vexed scientists for more than a decade and remains one of the biggest health dilemmas of human space exploration. But the findings from UT Southwestern -- which NASA enlisted to seek answers to astronauts' vision problems -- suggest the high-tech sacks may provide a solution. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.Notably, researchers found that while just three days of lying flat induced enough pressure to slightly alter the eyeball's shape, no such change occurred when the suction technology was used.

The condition is characterized by progressive flattening of the eyeball, swelling of the optic nerve, and vision impairment. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.Previous studies by UT Southwestern and the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas showed SANS is likely caused by the constant pressure that body fluids apply to the brain. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.SANS is not a problem on Earth, where gravity pulls fluids down into the body each time a person gets out of bed. In space, the lack of gravity prevents this daily unloading process, allowing more than half a gallon of body fluids to gather in the head and apply pressure to the eyeball. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.NASA has documented vision problems in more than half of the astronauts who served for at least six months on the International Space Station. Some became farsighted, had difficulty reading, and sometimes needed crewmates to assist in experiments. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.You can't stand up in space to unload the pressure. That's the problem," said Michael Stenger, Ph.D., a scientist with NASA's Human Health Countermeasures Element.

This condition can lead to blood clots, heart attacks or stroke. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.And it's certainly possible there are other effects of brain pressure we haven't documented yet," Dr. Levine said. "The astronauts report something they call the 'space stupids.' They make more mistakes than they think they should. Whether that has anything to do with the inability to lower the pressure, we don't know. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.Although some effects of SANS appear temporary -- vision returns to normal shortly after astronauts return to Earth -- Dr. Stenger said UT Southwestern's research is vital to the manned Mars flight that NASA hopes to launch in the 2030s. The sleeping bag technology, in particular, could address both the brain and heart issues. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.What are the long-term health consequences (of SANS)?" Dr. Stenger said. "There's a large team on the ground working to counteract a lot of these risks.

A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.To test his theory on brain pressure, Dr. Levine recruited cancer survivors from across the country who still had ports on their heads where they had received chemotherapy. These ports offered researchers rare access to measure pressure directly in the brain. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.The volunteers each went on a zero-gravity airplane flight into the upper atmosphere where their body fluids floated upward. A neurosurgeon from UT Southwestern's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute measured the brain pressure by inserting special equipment into the port. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.It was hard," recalled Wendy Hancock, a leukemia survivor from Philadelphia who agreed to go on more than three dozen up-and-down maneuvers into zero gravity. "But NASA is awesome, so, heck yeah, I was going to jump at the chance to help. â€¦ I did it for the astronauts. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.The resulting study showed that brain pressure in a person who lies down on Earth is actually higher than in space. However, on Earth the pressure is unloaded when the person stands and gravity pulls the fluids down. Space provides no such relief for astronauts.

A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.About a dozen people volunteered to test the technology, including Dr. Leidner, an internal medicine hospitalist in San Antonio who is interested in pursuing a career in aerospace medicine. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.He made two visits -- three days each -- to a UT Southwestern research room where he lay in bed. Only during the second visit was he placed in the sleeping bag for eight hours each night. Researchers compared changes in the brain after each stint. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.Being productive has gone out the window," he joked, pointing out the awkwardness of typing on his laptop while lying flat. "But it's an experience I could tell my kid one day if it helps humans land on Mars. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.Several questions need to be answered before NASA brings the technology on the space station, including the optimal amount of time astronauts should spend in the sleeping bag each day. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.But Dr. Levine said his latest findings indicate SANS hopefully won't be a health risk by the time the space agency is ready to launch to the Red Planet. A subtle smile emerged on Dr. James Leidner's face as he envisioned telling people of the unusual contribution he made to humankind's mission to Mars.This is perhaps one of the most mission-critical medical issues that has been discovered in the last decade for the space program," Dr. Levine said. "I'm thankful for the volunteers who are helping us understand, and hopefully, fix the problem.
