Future scientific work on this politically-fraught topic needs a more careful approach," write the scientists in a "Comment" published today in Nature Communications. The authors include global change biologist Colin J. Carlson, PhD, an assistant professor at Georgetown's Center for Global Health Science and Security; senior author Sadie Ryan, PhD, a medical geographer at the University of Florida; Georgetown disease ecologist Shweta Bansal, PhD; and Ana C. R. Gomez, a graduate student at UCLA. The research team says current messaging on social media and elsewhere "obscures key nuances" of the science around COVID-19 and seasonality. Weather probably influences COVID-19 transmission, but not at a scale sufficient to outweigh the effects of lockdowns or re-openings in populations," the authors write. The authors strongly discourage policy be tailored to current understandings of the COVID-climate link, and suggest a few key points: With current scientific data, COVID-19 interventions cannot currently be planned around seasonality," the authors conclude.
