The study, "Quantitative risk assessment of seafarers' nonfatal injuries due to occupational accidents based on Bayesian Network modeling," was conducted by a team of Singapore -based researchers. The team conducted an extensive survey to collect data on seafarers' working practice and their injury records. A survey was designed to test the following potential risk factors: sex, age, experience, nationality, ship type, position, time in position, tour duration, change of ship, familiarity, training, adequate rest, distraction, job risk awareness, job risk assessment, risk communication, procedure design, shortcut, housekeeping, defective equipment/tools, PPE availability, PPE training, PPE usage, reasons not using PPE, shore visit frequency, maintenance, accident feedback loop and injury during latest tour. The researchers collected 354 responses from seafarers in Singapore, China, South Korea and Vietnam. These countries were selected because of their high representation in the international seafaring market. The survey results indicated that: Since PPE availability is the most significant factor, it is suggested that: In situations where PPE was readily available, seafarers identified that the equipment's 'impact on efficiency' was the top factor that could hinder the use of PPE, followed by unavailable, uncomfortable and don't feel necessary. Management could improve upon these factors during the selection of PPEs and aim to develop a workplace culture that promotes PPE usage at all times. Shipping is the lifeblood of world trade and its viability depends on the key workforce -- seafarers, who are competent and have their occupational health and safety assured at work. This research reveals key findings related to factors that have been shown to have the greatest potential to decrease injury probability of seafarers -- the key element in the eco-system that contributes to IMO's goal of 'Safe, secure and efficient shipping on clean oceans,'" states Vinh Thai, associate professor at RMIT University, Australia.
