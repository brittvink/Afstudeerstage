Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.In research led by RMIT University's Dr Asma Khalid, smart wound dressings made of silk and nanodiamonds effectively sensed wound temperature, an early sign of infection, promoted healing and reduced infection from certain bacteria. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Senior researcher Professor Brant Gibson said it offered a solution to the global challenge of wound care and healing. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Traditional wound management presents a significant challenge for clinicians, who have to regularly check for infection by looking for signs of redness, heat and swelling," he said. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.However, once these visual signs appear, inflammation and infection are far advanced, making therapies or interventions substantially more challenging. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.This new technology would aid clinicians to detect infections earlier and non-invasively without the painful procedure of dressing removal. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Heat sensing capability  Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Co-researcher and wound specialist at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Dr Christina Bursill, said the smart wound dressing was a potential game changer. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.As a non-invasive measurement of wound temperature, this new technology provides a highly accurate way to monitor wound quality, compared to the very subjective method of visual assessment," she said. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.To incorporate the heat sensing capability, the team turned to diamonds which are known to detect biological temperature to a highly precise level. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.By embedding nanodiamonds into silk fibres using an electrospinning process, we've been able to develop a naturally derived wound dressing that can sense infections," Vice-Chancellor Fellow at RMIT Dr Asma Khalid, explained. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.The heat sensing capability opens the possibility of contactless wound monitoring by clinicians who would be able to obtain information on the wound's status from the nanodiamond temperature readout. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Bacterial resistance  Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.The study in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces also tested the hybrid technology for resistance to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, the major players in skin wound infections. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.These leading causes of wound or surgical infections in healthcare settings are increasingly resistant to most available antibiotics," Khalid noted. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.We were very excited to find the nanodiamond silk membranes showed an extremely high antibacterial resistance to gram negative bacteria," she said. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.The study shows the smart membranes can detect early signs of infection and protect wounds from certain bacteria and infection, while also maintaining the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the area. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.Realising this exciting new technology would provide a beneficial and cost-effective solution to the increasing challenge of wound management and healing," Khalid said. Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.The research consortium included scientists from RMIT University, the Universities of Adelaide and Melbourne, Flinders University, SAHMRI and the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP). Scientists have developed a next generation wound dressing that can detect infection and improve healing in burns, skin grafts and chronic wounds.The work was supported by RMIT University's Vice Chancellor Fellowship and the ARC through the CNPB and a Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) grant.
