Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.A new study published today in Nature Climate Change is the first to analyse global sea-level rise combined with measurements of sinking land. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.The impact of subsidence combined with sea-level rise has until now been considered a local issue rather than a global one. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.But the new study shows that coastal inhabitants are living with an average sea level rise of 7.8 mm -- 9.9 mm per year over the past twenty years, compared with a global average rise of 2.6mm a year. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.And the impacts are far larger than the global numbers reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.Lead researcher Prof Robert Nicholls, Director of the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and Chair of Climate Adaptation at the University of East Anglia, said: "Climate induced sea-level rise is caused by melting glaciers and thermal expansion of water due to rising global temperatures. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.Rapid rates of subsidence in deltas and especially cities on deltas are also human-caused, mostly due to groundwater pumping, also oil and gas extraction, and sediment resupply prevented by upstream dams, flood defences, sand extraction or mining. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.About 58 per cent of the world's coastal population lives on deltas where land is subsiding. Less than 1 per cent of global coastal population lives where land is uplifting. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.We wanted to look at the big picture globally, to better understand the impact of global sea-level rise combined with measurements of sinking land. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.We found that coastal populations live with sea-level rise at three and four times the global average and that the impacts of sea-level rise being experienced today are much larger than the global numbers being reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.Addressing human-induced subsidence is important in the short term, as it is an essential coastal adaptation to protect people and economies," he added. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.The research team assessed four components of relative sea-level change -- climate induced sea-level change, the effects of glacier weight removal causing land uplift or sinking, estimates of river delta subsidence and subsidence in cities. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.Sea-level measurements were taken from satellite data. The team then weighted their results by population to show their importance to people. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.The overall analysis used the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model which is designed for understanding coastal management needs. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.They found that high rates of relative sea-level rise are most urgent in South, South East and East Asia as the area has many subsiding deltas and coastal flood plains, growing coastal megacities and more than 70 per cent of the world's coastal population. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.They also found that over the 20th Century, the city of Tokyo experienced net subsidence of 4m, while Shanghai, Bangkok, New Orleans, and Jakarta, have experienced between 2m and 3m subsidence. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.In Tokyo, Shanghai and Bangkok the subsidence has been stopped or greatly reduced by reduced groundwater extraction, while in other cities there has been little direct response to reduce subsidence. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.Prof Robert Nicholls said: "One of the main reasons that Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is being moved to Borneo is because the city is sinking due to groundwater extraction from shallow wells. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.We hope that our analysis improves the understanding of how sea-level rise and subsidence are hand-in hand for science and coastal management policy worldwide. Jakarta might be just the beginning. Coastal populations are experiencing relative sea-level rise up to four times faster than the global average -- according to new research from the University of East Anglia.The research was led by the University of East Anglia (UK) in collaboration with the Global Climate Forum, Berlin (Germany), Humboldt-University, Berlin (Germany), Bournemouth University (UK), Kiel University (Germany), Universit√© de Toulouse (France), the University of Southampton (UK) and East China Normal University, Shanghai (China).
