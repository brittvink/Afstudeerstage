In a new study, Yale professors Madhav Dhodapkar, Richard Flavell, and their co-authors describe new mouse models, wherein mice carry human versions of six genes that are essential for growth of tumor cells. The found that when the humanized mice were injected with tumor and non-tumor cells, both cell types were able to grow. The finding provides a potential new approach to understanding how myeloma develops and how to prevent it. This study has been published in Nature Medicine.
