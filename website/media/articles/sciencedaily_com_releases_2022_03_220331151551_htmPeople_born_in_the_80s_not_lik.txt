Published today in Advances in Life Course Research, the peer-reviewed study, used data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society study (UKHLS). The study sample contained 3,233 individuals from three birth cohorts: 1974-1979, 1980-1984 and 1985-1990, who were observed between 1991 and 2016 and were aged between 16 and 27.The research team from UCL and the University of St Andrews found that the 70s cohort had a 50/50 chance of splitting or staying (or marrying) their first partner. The youngest cohort was significantly more likely to separate from their partners than to marry them.

The study sample contained 3,233 individuals from three birth cohorts: 1974-1979, 1980-1984 and 1985-1990, who were observed between 1991 and 2016 and were aged between 16 and 27.When looking at how long people stayed together, within the two oldest cohorts, 25%-27% of couples had separated within two years from the start of cohabitation. This figure is 43% in the youngest cohort suggesting that first cohabiting partnerships have become less stable and do not last as long among younger generations.

The authors say find that living with someone (rather than marriage) has become an almost universal form of first partnership regardless of socio-economic background or educational level.

This raises interesting questions on the meaning young people attach to cohabitation and the quality of these partnerships which tend to be short-lived.

The study found a positive link between education levels and the transition from cohabitation to marriage for cohorts born between 1974-1979, suggesting that education contributes to partnership stability. In contrast, among those born in the 1980s, more highly educated people are more likely to move in with a partner. However, levels of education do not affect the stability of these partnerships as they almost universally end in separation.

Postponement of first partnership formation among those not pursuing further education could also be a marker of the increased economic hardship and uncertainties.

While they do not expect this to affect the overall rates of first partnership formation, it might reveal some new findings, if the first partnerships of those beyond age 27 turn out to be more stable.
