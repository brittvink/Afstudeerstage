The lake level of the Dead Sea is currently dropping by more than one metre every year -- mainly because of the heavy water consumption in the catchment area. However, very strong lake level drops due to climate changes are also known from earlier times. At the end of the last ice age, for example, the water level dropped by almost 250 metres within a few millennia. A study published today in the journal Scientific Reports now provides new insights into the exact course of this process. Daniela Müller and Achim Brauer from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam, together with colleagues from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, studied 15,000-year-old sediments from the Dead Sea and the surrounding area using newly developed methods. With unprecedented accuracy, they show that the long period of drought was interrupted by wet periods lasting ten to a hundred years. This also offers new insights into the settlement history of this region, which is significant for human development, and enables better assessments of current and future developments driven by climate change.The water cycle at the Dead Sea -- then and now The lake level of the Dead Sea is currently dropping by more than one metre every year -- mainly because of the heavy water consumption in the catchment area.

Geologists can achieve this by assessing strong hydroclimatic changes that occurred several millennia back in time. For example, during the transition from the last ice age to the Holocene, the water level of Lake Lisan dropped by about 240 metres in the period 24-11 thousand years ago, which eventually led to its transition into today's Dead Sea. The lake level of the Dead Sea is currently dropping by more than one metre every year -- mainly because of the heavy water consumption in the catchment area. However, very strong lake level drops due to climate changes are also known from earlier times.

In their new study, researchers led by Achim Brauer, head of Section 4.3 "Climate Dynamics and Landscape Evolution" at the German Research Centre for Geosciences Potsdam, and doctoral student Daniela Müller together with colleagues from the Geological Survey Israel and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, analysed these sediments with unprecedented precision. The investigations took place within the framework of the PALEX project 'Paleohydrology and Extreme Floods from the Dead Sea ICDP Core', which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

This enables the precise identification and localisation of elements in the sediments. Important and challenging for this is the preparation of the sediments for this analysis: The moisture must be removed from them by freeze-drying -- not easy given the high salt content of the Dead Sea and its affinity for water. Then the sediments are impregnated in synthetic resin and thin sections are made from them. In all this, the microstructure must not be altered.

"In this study, we were able for the first time to precisely determine the duration of these phases with several decades and in one case up to centuries by counting annual layers in the sediment," says Daniela Müller, lead author of the study. The exact reason for these pauses in the climate change of this region still remain elusive. Possible links to North Atlantic climate are suspected.

Climatically stable phases could have favoured the cultural developments.

We learn from this that climate change is not linear, but that phases of strong changes alternate with calm phases," says Achim Brauer.
