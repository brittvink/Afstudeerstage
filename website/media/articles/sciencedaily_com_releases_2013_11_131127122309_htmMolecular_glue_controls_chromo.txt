Cohesin is essential to hold replicated chromosomes together.  Using molecular “scissors” in the form of TEV protease, the researchers inactivated cohesin to generate chromosomes that cannot bi-orient on the spindle and therefore would be expected to activate a checkpoint response and trigger a cell cycle arrest.  Instead, they found that oocytes in which cohesin has been destroyed still divide and produce highly aneuploid eggs.  Therefore, cohesin is required for a robust SAC in oocytes. This has important implications for ageing oocytes, where cohesin deterioration will compromise the SAC, leading to chromosome segregation errors.
