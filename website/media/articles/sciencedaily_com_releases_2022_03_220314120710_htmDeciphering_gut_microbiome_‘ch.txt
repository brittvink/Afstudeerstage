Around 500,000 people in the UK live with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a life-long, chronic condition characterised by sporadic bouts of gut inflammation causing debilitating symptoms. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.Scientists at the Earlham Institute, Quadram Institute and University of East Anglia on the Norwich Research Park, have developed a new computational biology method to better understand IBD for targeted clinical treatments. By analysing specific differences in gut cell types, the study deciphers cellular crosstalk to identify how beneficial bacteria communicate with our immune system to treat IBD and reduce gut inflammation.

Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.The human gut harbours a community of microbes, known collectively as the microbiome, which is crucial to maintaining good health. A disrupted microbiome can cause gut-related conditions including IBD, an immune-linked inflammatory disease that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea and extreme fatigue. Around 500,000 people in the UK live with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a life-long, chronic condition characterised by sporadic bouts of gut inflammation causing debilitating symptoms. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.People with IBD tend to have reduced diversity or a change in the balance in their gut microbiome, especially of Bacteroides and Firmicutes bacteria. However, we still don't know how exactly this translates to the triggering and progression of IBD. By understanding how these bacteria interact with the gut lining, and the immune system, and how this differs in IBD, we can better understand the causes and start developing targeted, effective treatments. Around 500,000 people in the UK live with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a life-long, chronic condition characterised by sporadic bouts of gut inflammation causing debilitating symptoms. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.But to decipher this crosstalk across the different kingdoms of life, you need to understand how bacteria communicate, and then how human cells react to that information. This quest united microbiologist and immunologist Professor Simon Carding from the Quadram Institute and UEA, with Dr Tam치s Korcsm치ros, a systems biologist whose expertise lies in cellular signalling networks from the Earlham and the Quadram Institutes. Around 500,000 people in the UK live with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a life-long, chronic condition characterised by sporadic bouts of gut inflammation causing debilitating symptoms. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.Professor Carding and his team have been investigating Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles (BEVs), which are tiny packages created by bacteria that they fill with various molecules and release from the cell. They can cross the gut lining, reaching cells of the immune system where they are recognised by receptors. The contents of the BEVs are molecular signals that then trigger the immune cells to react, with that signal potentially cascading into widespread effects.

Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.In a healthy gut, BEVs and their cargo can contribute to anti-inflammatory responses of the immune system, but in an inflamed IBD patient's gut, this response is lost. BEVs could therefore be used as a potential new therapy. But currently, we don't understand enough about how they interact with the complex immune system. Our immune response relies on different types of cells monitoring for a plethora of different signals and interacting with each other to respond appropriately to a perceived threat of infection locally, and systematically across the body.

Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.To address this knowledge gap, Dr Tam치s Korcsm치ros and his team used a previously published dataset about which genes are actively making proteins in 51 types of colon cells, from either healthy conditions or under the effect of ulcerative colitis. Uniquely, this dataset contained inflamed and uninflamed data from the same patients, allowing investigation of the effect of inflammation and not only the complex disease.

Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.The team also analysed and characterised all of the cargo proteins obtained from BEVs made by the common gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt).

Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis -- the latter affecting around 1 in 400 people -- are the two most common types of IBD. Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.They then combined these datasets using an experimentally verified computational pipeline (called MicrobioLink) that predicts the interactions between microbial and host proteins, and how these triggers complex networks of cascading signalling systems. From this they could build up an overall picture of which microbial proteins were able to interact with which human proteins in the different types of immune cell and identify the differences between these networks in a healthy gut and in IBD.

Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.This model, called an interactome, provides a snapshot of the constant communication between gut bacteria and our own immune system. From this the researchers could get an idea of the biological processes affected by microbial proteins -- in healthy and inflamed UC conditions.

Current treatments are ineffective and seriously impact the quality of life of the patients and those of their families.Many interactions were identified common across cell types, but the research uncovered many biological processes that were specific to one type of immune cell. Focussing specifically on one pathway known to be important in immunity and inflammation, they were also able to identify differences between the same cell types in healthy and ulcerative colitis conditions. Experiments using cell cultures grown together with BEVs validated the predictions from the computational modelling.

Then you need a computational pipeline to analyse the data from different patients. Besides the actual scientific results, in the paper we introduce an open-source pipeline that others can use to analyse their data" said Dr Tam치s Korcsm치ros. "We hope that what we have demonstrated here in this study will be applied by others for understanding the mechanisms how other bacterial species communicate with our cells, and how it may be altered in other diseases.
