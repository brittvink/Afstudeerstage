You can carry an entire computer in your pocket today because the technological building blocks have been getting smaller and smaller since the 1950s. But in order to create future generations of electronics -- such as more powerful phones, more efficient solar cells, or even quantum computers -- scientists will need to come up with entirely new technology at the tiniest scales.One area of interest is nanocrystals. These tiny crystals can assemble themselves into many configurations, but scientists have had trouble figuring out how to make them talk to each other.

Published March 25 in Science, the research may open the doors to future devices with new abilities.

"But until now, it has been very difficult to both assemble them into structures and have them talk to each other. Now for the first time, we don't have to choose. This is a transformative improvement. You can carry an entire computer in your pocket today because the technological building blocks have been getting smaller and smaller since the 1950s.

But the trouble was that whenever they tried to assemble these nanocrystals together into arrays, the new supercrystals would grow with long "hairs" around them.

But in order to create future generations of electronics -- such as more powerful phones, more efficient solar cells, or even quantum computers -- scientists will need to come up with entirely new technology at the tiniest scales.These hairs made it difficult for electrons to jump from one nanocrystal to another. Electrons are the messengers of electronic communication; their ability to move easily along is a key part of any electronic device.

But in order to create future generations of electronics -- such as more powerful phones, more efficient solar cells, or even quantum computers -- scientists will need to come up with entirely new technology at the tiniest scales.The researchers needed a method to reduce the hairs around each nanocrystal, so they could pack them in more tightly and reduce the gaps in between. "When these gaps are smaller by just a factor of three, the probability for electrons to jump across is about a billion times higher," said Talapin, the Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering at UChicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. "It changes very strongly with distance. You can carry an entire computer in your pocket today because the technological building blocks have been getting smaller and smaller since the 1950s. But in order to create future generations of electronics -- such as more powerful phones, more efficient solar cells, or even quantum computers -- scientists will need to come up with entirely new technology at the tiniest scales.To shave off the hairs, they sought to understand what was going on at the atomic level. For this, they needed the aid of powerful X-rays at the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, as well as powerful simulations and models of the chemistry and physics at play. All these allowed them to understand what was happening at the surface -- and find the key to harnessing their production.

It turns out that as the crystals grow, they undergo an unusual transformation in which gas, liquid and solid phases all coexist. By precisely controlling the chemistry of that stage, they could create crystals with harder, slimmer exteriors which could be packed in together much more closely. "Understanding their phase behavior was a massive leap forward for us," said Portner.

"For example, perhaps each crystal could be a qubit in a quantum computer; coupling qubits into arrays is one of the fundamental challenges of quantum technology right now," said Talapin.
