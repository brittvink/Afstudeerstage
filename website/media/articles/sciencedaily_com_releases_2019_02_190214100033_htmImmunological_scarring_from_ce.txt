Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.This permanent 'immunological scarring' lays the foundation for the disease to progress and could have long-term implications for gut health in affected patients. Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.The results also suggest that the same process could be contributing to other chronic intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.Dr James McLaren, from Cardiff University's School of Medicine, said: "In celiac disease, T cells found in the bowel react to gluten and cause inflammation, which damages the lining of the bowel. Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.Under normal circumstances, T cells have a protective role in the bowel and form a stable population. However, in celiac disease, they contribute to the inflammatory process, causing short-term symptoms and increasing the risk of developing certain types of bowel cancer. Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.Our new study suggests that even though short-term symptoms, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, can be alleviated by removing gluten from the diet, long-term implications may remain, because 'tissue-healing' T cells in the bowel are permanently replaced by 'pro-inflammatory' T cells. Immune cells in the bowel of people who suffer with celiac disease are permanently replaced by a new subset of cells that promote inflammation, suggests a new study involving researchers at Cardiff University.Celiac disease is common and affects one in 100 people. The international team hope the new findings will help inform the treatment of chronic intestinal disorders.
