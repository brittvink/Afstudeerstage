A team led by scientists at the University of Washington and special agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has used genetic testing of ivory shipments seized by law enforcement to uncover the international criminal networks behind ivory trafficking out of Africa. The genetic connections across shipments that they've uncovered exposes an even higher degree of organization among ivory smuggling networks than previously known.The paper, published Feb. 14 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, incorporates results from DNA testing of more than 4,000 African elephant tusks from 49 different ivory seizures made in 12 African nations over a 17-year period.

Although ivory seizures by authorities come from elephants that have already been slaughtered, the tusks can provide valuable information by illuminating the poaching, shipment activities and connectivity of traffickers.

The genetic connections across shipments that they've uncovered exposes an even higher degree of organization among ivory smuggling networks than previously known.Previous work by Wasser and his collaborators -- published in 2018 in the journal Science Advances -- identified tusks from the same elephant that were separated and smuggled in different shipments prior to being seized by law enforcement. Finding both tusks from the same individual linked those seizures to the same trafficking networks. Those efforts indicated that, from 2011 to 2014, cartels tended to smuggle ivory out of three African ports: Mombasa, Kenya; Entebbe, Uganda; and Lom√©, Togo.

Adding close relatives expands the scope of the effort, Wasser said.

But identifying close relatives is going to be a much more common event, and can link more ivory seizures to the same smuggling networks," said Wasser.

Results showed that a majority of these shipments could be linked based on matching tusks either from the same individual or from close relatives.

The genetic connections across shipments that they've uncovered exposes an even higher degree of organization among ivory smuggling networks than previously known.Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly -- year after year -- and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network," said Wasser. "This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports," said Wasser.

By expanding the analysis to identify tusks from close relatives, the team could also link seizures from a dozen countries in Central and West Africa, stretching from Ivory Coast on the Atlantic Ocean to Mozambique on the Indian Ocean.

In West Africa, a temporal shift occurred from Togo to Nigeria.

But the genetic evidence by Wasser and his team could strengthen investigations and prosecutions by linking responsible transnational criminal organizations to multiple seizures -- leading to more severe penalties.
