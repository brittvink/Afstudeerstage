The nanoparticle we developed is a powerful new delivery system for genome editing in vascular endothelial cells, and could be used to treat many diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19," said senior author Dr. Zhao from Lurie Children's. "With this nanoparticle we can introduce genes to inhibit vascular injury and/or promote vascular repair, correct gene mutations and turn genes on or off to restore normal function. It also allows us to edit multiple genes at the same time. This is an important advance for treating any disease caused by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is at the root of many diseases, such as coronary artery disease, stroke, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary artery hypertension. Dr. Zhao explained that genome editing in endothelial cells could even treat cancers by cutting off the blood supply to the tumor or blocking cancer metastasis. At this stage, Dr. Zhao and colleagues achieved excellent results in a mouse model. The nanoparticle carrying CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid DNA was introduced via a one-time IV injection and required a few days to be effective. Preclinical testing will be necessary before clinical trials can begin. Our nanoparticle delivery system for genome editing and transgene expression also is a huge advance for cardiovascular research," added Dr. Zhao.
