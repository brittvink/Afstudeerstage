Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The Global Neurotrauma Outcomes Study, funded by the NIHR, is published in The Lancet Neurology and provides data to assist in decision making and improving outcome for patients with traumatic brain injury globally. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The paper focuses on types of cases, the way they are managed, and death rates, and was compiled using data submitted by 159 hospitals in 57 countries to a central database, which the researchers then analysed. The researchers stratified countries into four tiers (very high, high, medium, low) according to their Human Development Index (HDI), which takes account of factors like life expectancy, education, and income. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The prospective study determined that patients in the low HDI tier were often young and tended to suffer skull fractures due to assault but were classified as 'mild' traumatic brain injury (TBI). Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.In the medium and high HDI tiers, patients were also young, but most had moderate to severe TBI caused by a road traffic collision and extradural haematoma -- a bleed on the outside of the dura mater, the membrane covering of the brain. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.In the very high tier, patients tended to be older and presented with a moderate or severe TBI associated with a fall and acute subdural haematoma -- a bleed on the inner surface of the dura mater. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.Quality of care was generally less favourable in lower HDI settings, including delays to surgery and a lack of postoperative monitoring equipment and intensive care. The very high HDI tier had the highest proportion of operations in which the most senior surgeon present in the operating theatre was a fully qualified neurosurgeon, while the medium HDI tier had the lowest proportion. The study also found significant variations between hospitals in the outcome of patients.

Many of these patients would have died without an operation. However, we also need to address deficits in pre-hospital management and long-term rehabilitation. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.David Clark, a trainee neurosurgeon and University of Cambridge research fellow, said: "A particularly important finding is that outcome is influenced more by hospital characteristics than country of origin, which raises the possibility that changing the systems and processes of care in individual hospitals might be able to improve mortality. The paper sows the seeds for discussion and change. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The research was funded by the NIHR using UK government aid to support global health research. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.Alexis Joannides, Consultant Neurosurgeon at CUH and NIHR Global Neurotrauma Research Group informatics lead, added: "The contribution of several clinicians and researchers from several hospitals across the world has been possible due to the infrastructure and collaborations supported by the NIHR. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The database and data management process used in the study have now laid the foundation for a global registry of traumatic brain injuries that we have established to support ongoing quality improvement and research in the field of traumatic brain injury. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.Peter Hutchinson, Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of Cambridge and Director of the NIHR Global Neurotrauma Research Group, said: "This is the largest study in the world looking at the surgical management of head injuries and will be of practical value to clinicians and others planning strategies for the future. Neurosurgery experts from Cambridge have led the largest ever study examining the surgical management of traumatic brain injuries, highlighting regional inequalities in both major causes and treatment of such injuries.The collaboration across such a vast number of hospitals and countries, together with the support of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and continental neurosurgical societies, has been phenomenal.
