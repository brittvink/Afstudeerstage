University of Cincinnati clinician-scientist Soma Sengupta, MD, PhD, says that new findings from her and Daniel Pomeranz Krummel's, PhD, team might have identified a treatment-boosting drug to enhance effectiveness of therapies for metastatic cancer and make them less toxic, giving patients a fighting chance at survival and improved quality of life.Melanoma is a serious skin cancer that evolves from the pigment cells of the skin and eyes," says Sengupta, associate professor of neurology at UC, UC Health neuro-oncologist and co-director of the UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute's Brain Tumor Center. "There are millions of people in the U.S. living with this type of cancer, and the incidence is projected to increase.

Often, patients who receive immunotherapy, which uses the patient's own immune system to treat the condition, do not have good responses. They also experience many uncomfortable side effects that impact their quality of life.

These studies were conducted in animal models but the hope is to soon study outcomes in patients with metastatic cancer.

They are collaborating with investigators from UC who are helping to formulate the lead compound, including Pankaj Desai, PhD, with the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy, as well as with Mohammad Khan, PhD, of Emory University, who will test this approach via clinical trial once Sengupta has approval from the FDA to test this drug in humans.

More studies are needed, but this is a promising new approach using a non-toxic drug from a class of compounds that have already been approved for anxiety, but now used for a serious condition that claims lives every day.

Sadly, Stambrook passed away from melanoma before their work was published.

"He was an outstanding scientist and was incredibly supportive of our research. We feel more driven than ever to push forward with our research and to honor Peter in this way.
