Researchers have developed a new measurement and imaging approach that can resolve nanostructures smaller than the diffraction limit of light without requiring any dyes or labels. The work represents an important advance toward a new and powerful microscopy method that could one day be used to see the fine features of complex samples beyond what is possible with conventional microscopes and techniques.The new method, described in Optica, is a modification of laser scanning microscopy, which uses a strongly focused laser beam to illuminate a sample. The researchers expanded on the technique by measuring not only the brightness, or intensity, of the light after it interacts with a specimen under study, but also detecting other parameters encoded in the light field.

The work represents an important advance toward a new and powerful microscopy method that could one day be used to see the fine features of complex samples beyond what is possible with conventional microscopes and techniques.In laser-scanning microscopy, a light beam is scanned across the sample and the transmitted, reflected or scattered light coming from the sample is measured. Although most microscopy methods measure the intensity, or brightness, of light coming from the sample, a great deal of information is also stored in other characteristics of the light such as its phase, polarization and the scattering angle. To capture this additional information, the researchers examined the spatial resolution of the intensity and polarization information.

"However, much of this information is ignored if only the overall light power is measured after the interaction.

They did this by scanning the area of interest and then recording polarization and angle-resolved images of the transmitted light. The measured data was evaluated using an algorithm that creates a model of the particles that automatically adapts to resemble the measured data as precisely as possible.

"In addition, and even more importantly, the algorithm was able to provide other parameters about the sample such as the precise size and position of the particles.

The functionality of the approach can also be expanded by tailoring the structure of the light that interacts with the sample and incorporating artificial intelligence-based approaches into the image processing steps. On the detection side, the authors, together with other experts, are currently developing a special camera as part of a European project called SuperPixels. This next-generation detection device will becapable of resolving polarization and phase information in addition to intensity.
