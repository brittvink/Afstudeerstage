Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.This is the key finding of a new study by Clemson University researchers and published in the most recent issue of Journal of Sports Media. Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.Social media has been embraced by the sports world at an extraordinary pace and has become a viable avenue for sports broadcasters to redefine their roles as celebrities," said Melinda Weathers, lead author on the study and assistant professor of communication studies at Clemson. "However, given the differences in the ways females and males are utilized in sports broadcasts, we found there are also disparities in how they present themselves on social media. Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.This study explored self-presentation strategies used by sports broadcasters Erin Andrews and Kirk Herbstreit on Twitter with attention focused on potential gender differences. Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.Although each broadcaster used Twitter in some complementary ways, there were clear differences that seemed to fall along traditional gender boundaries inherent in sports media, as Andrews primarily discussed personal items, whereas Herbstreit largely provided sports-related commentary and analysis," says Weathers. Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.Andrews heavily promoted her sense of fashion and engaged non-sports related celebrities, offering little in the way of sports insight and opinion. Herbstreit, on the other hand, focused more on game-related information and connecting with sports-related people, while offering very little in the way of his personal life or popular culture and entertainment.

"The absence of such commentary suggests that Andrews' reticence may be attributed to perceived backlash from followers.

Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.If male and female sports broadcasters by and large conform to expected gender roles, it may become extremely difficult for a broadcaster of either gender to break the script and deviate from expectations," stated Weathers. Twitter provides an avenue for female sports broadcasters to break down gender barriers, yet it currently serves to express their subordinate sports media roles.While Twitter possesses exciting potential for female athletes, reporters and broadcasters to break out of traditional gender molds in sports media, it appears that a pioneer is still needed in the digital realm, according to the researchers.
