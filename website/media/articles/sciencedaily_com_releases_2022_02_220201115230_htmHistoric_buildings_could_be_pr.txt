Researchers from the Centre for Doctoral Training in New and Sustainable Photovoltaics -- a consortium of seven universities led by the University of Bath that trains doctoral students in different aspects of solar energy technology -- looked at the dimensions, tilt and orientation of the Abbey roof, along with historic weather data, and shading of the roof from spires, to model the best configuration for 164 photovoltaic (PV) panels and estimated the amount of electricity that could be generated in a normal year.They found that the set up could produce around 45 Mega-Watt hours per year, which accounts for roughly 35% of the Abbey's annual usage. The equivalent amount of carbon dioxide saved, versus buying the electricity from the National Grid, would be around 10 tonnes per year, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the building.

It would also future-proof the Abbey from rising costs of energy bills. The findings show that despite a large initial outlay, the system would be financially feasible for the historic grade I listed building.

This is equivalent to the emissions of an average vehicle driving 80,000km -- almost twice the circumference of the Earth.
