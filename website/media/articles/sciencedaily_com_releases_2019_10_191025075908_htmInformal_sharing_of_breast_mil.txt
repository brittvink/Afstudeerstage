"It is therefore crucial that physicians become aware of this practice and the associated risks so that they can educate patients and address this growing concern.

Women who are unable to produce enough milk to exclusively breastfeed their child may supplement infant diets with formula or donor breast milk that is available through formal milk banks.

"In addition to educating patients, physicians must underscore the importance of discussing these habits with medical professionals so that we have the necessary information to make accurate diagnoses should a medical need arise.
