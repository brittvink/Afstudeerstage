The researchers previously developed a  test to detect low levels of prion protein in the blood. In this study,  they used the test on samples from national blood collection and prion  disease centers in the U.S. and the U.K. to see if it was accurate  enough to screen large numbers of people. Samples represented U.S. blood  donors (n=5,000), healthy U.K. donors (n=200), patients with nonprion  neurodegenerative disease (n=352), patients in whom a prion disease  diagnosis was likely (n=105) and patients with confirmed vCJD (n=10). The test was perfectly specific, meaning it was always  negative in negative American donor samples and healthy U.K. patient  samples. No samples tested positive from patients with nonprion  neurodegenerative disorders. The test found 71.4 percent of patients  with vCJD correctly tested positive. The prion assay (test) in this study is accurate enough  to screen populations at risk for vCJD. "Most importantly, the prototype  vCJD assay [test] has sufficient performance to justify now screening a  large U.K. population sample and at-risk groups to produce an initial  estimate of the level of prionemia [prions in the blood] in the U.K.  blood donor population. â€¦ A blood prevalence study would provide  essential information for policy makers for deciding if routine vCJD  screening is needed for blood, tissue, and organ donations and patients  prior to high-risk surgical procedures.
