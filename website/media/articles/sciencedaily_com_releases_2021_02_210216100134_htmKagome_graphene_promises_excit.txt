These new substances are an important step in the development of highly energy-efficient electronics. The starting material is often a single-layer honeycomb structure of carbon atoms (graphene).

Kagome graphene consists of a regular pattern of hexagons and equilateral triangles that surround one another. The name "kagome" comes from Japanese and refers to the old Japanese art of kagome weaving, in which baskets were woven in the aforementioned pattern.
