Those nice new clothes you got for Christmas or in the new year sales might just last longer, thanks to advice from scientists researching the impact washing machines have on clothes and the environment.Academics from the University of Leeds and specialists from Procter & Gamble, makers of Ariel, Daz, Bold, Fairy and Lenor, have wrung out new insight into how laundering clothing affects fading, colour runs and microfibre release. Those nice new clothes you got for Christmas or in the new year sales might just last longer, thanks to advice from scientists researching the impact washing machines have on clothes and the environment.Every load of washing releases hundreds of thousands of microfibres -- tiny strands that are flushed down the drain. Many reach beaches and oceans where they can remain for many years and be swallowed by sea creatures.

Their findings are published today in the journal Dyes and Pigments.

The research was repeated and validated with authentic loads of dirty laundry provided by UK consumers.

Chemical analysis distinguished individual dyes washed out of the clothing, and microfibres were collected and weighed.

Those nice new clothes you got for Christmas or in the new year sales might just last longer, thanks to advice from scientists researching the impact washing machines have on clothes and the environment.Synthetic microfibres are released every time textiles are washed and account for more than a third of all plastic reaching the ocean. But microfibres from cotton and other natural sources are found in even greater numbers in the sea, and we're worried about their impact too. Those nice new clothes you got for Christmas or in the new year sales might just last longer, thanks to advice from scientists researching the impact washing machines have on clothes and the environment.Our research shows that consumers can actively reduce the number of microfibres released from their own clothing simply by washing in quicker, cooler cycles. Those nice new clothes you got for Christmas or in the new year sales might just last longer, thanks to advice from scientists researching the impact washing machines have on clothes and the environment.What is more, washing clothes at 20째C rather than 40째C saves approximately 66% of the energy used per load -- according to the Energy Saving Trust, providing even more reason to use quicker, cooler cycles to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions.

It's a real win win win.
