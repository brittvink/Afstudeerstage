Dellavalle, M.D., Ph.D., M.S.P.H., of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, and coauthors suggests any lifetime use of steroids was most strongly associated with indoor tanning, especially among adolescent boys. Alcohol consumption in the past 30 days, marijuana use and lifetime use of select illicit drugs also were associated with indoor tanning, according to the results.
