On the evening of Aug. 20, 2014, the International Space Station was  flying past North America when it flew over the dazzling, green blue  lights of an aurora. On board, astronaut Reid Wiseman captured this  image of the aurora, seen from above.This auroral display was due to a giant cloud of gas from the sun – a  coronal mass ejection or CME – that collided with Earth's magnetic  fields on Aug. 19, 2014, at 1:57 a.m. EDT. This event set off, as it  often does, what's called a geomagnetic storm.  This is a kind of space  weather event where the magnetic fields surrounding Earth compress and  release. This oscillation is much like a spring moving back and forth,  but unlike a spring, moving magnetic fields cause an unstable  environment, setting charged particles moving and initiating electric  currents.

On board, astronaut Reid Wiseman captured this  image of the aurora, seen from above.The geomagnetic storm passed within 24 hours or so but, while it was  ongoing, the solar particles and magnetic fields caused the release of  particles already trapped near Earth.  These, in turn, triggered  reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules  released photons of light.  On the evening of Aug. 20, 2014, the International Space Station was  flying past North America when it flew over the dazzling, green blue  lights of an aurora.
