In two publications in Nature Medicine, a European-Israeli team of researchers show how major disturbances occur in the gut microbiome of patients suffering from heart disease. Given this latest evidence from microbiome research, one of the senior lead researchers, Professor Oluf Pedersen from the University of Copenhagen, calls for stronger and more focused public health initiatives to prevent or delay these common diseases that are a leading cause of premature death worldwide through plant-based and energy-controlled diet, avoidance of smoking and compliance with daily exercise.The human gut contains trillions of bacteria, collectively called the gut microbiome, which may have positive and negative effects on human health. When in balance they function as an inner chemistry factory producing numerous compounds that promote good health. However, an unhealthy lifestyle -- poor diet, smoking, lack of physical activity or disease -- can disrupt the balance, leading the microbiome to instead produce compounds that may trigger multiple non-communicable chronic disorders in people at high genetic risk, including myocardial infarction, angina or heart failure.

They subsequently identified compounds that are produced by the diseased microbiome, for instance a bacterial compound called trimethylamine (TMA) that after modification in the liver of the human host causes arteriosclerosis. In two publications in Nature Medicine, a European-Israeli team of researchers show how major disturbances occur in the gut microbiome of patients suffering from heart disease. Given this latest evidence from microbiome research, one of the senior lead researchers, Professor Oluf Pedersen from the University of Copenhagen, calls for stronger and more focused public health initiatives to prevent or delay these common diseases that are a leading cause of premature death worldwide through plant-based and energy-controlled diet, avoidance of smoking and compliance with daily exercise.However, these findings of altered gut microbiome are challenged because they were achieved in studies of medicated patients. Patients with heart disease are given several different drugs, each of which are known to modify the gut microbiome. As a result, it was unclear whether drugs or heart disease itself caused the disrupted gut microbiome of people with cardiovascular disorders.

As a result, it remained to be shown whether an imbalanced gut microbiome is a feature of heart disease itself.

Among the principal investigators is Professor Oluf Pedersen from the University of Copenhagen who, together with his colleagues, published the consortium's findings in in the journal Nature Medicine.

The investigators quantified about 700 different bacterial species and estimated their functions in the gut microbiome and compared these findings to more than 1,000 compounds circulating in blood with many of these compounds originating from the inner gut chemistry factory.

Both at the early dysmetabolic stage and at the later stages of diagnosed heart disease, the diseased microbiome was characterized by a loss of bacterial cells and bacterial competences. In addition, the patients showed a shift towards fewer types of bacteria known to produce health promoting compounds like short chain fatty acids and more bacteria types producing unhealthy compounds from the metabolism of certain dietary amino acids, choline and L-carnitine. Analyses of the blood compounds mirrored the imbalance of the gut microbiome.

These microbiome changes are not explained by drug treatments," says Oluf Pedersen.

However, Professor Oluf Pedersen stresses that in the past decade a number of cellular and animal experiments into specific microbiome-derived compounds -- like the ones identified in the present studies -- have demonstrated how the imbalanced gut microbiome may play a role in the development of heart disease.

It is time for translating the accumulated evidence of the role of the gut microbiome to more focused public health initiatives in attempts to prevent or delay morbidity and mortality related to heart disease," says Professor Oluf Pedersen, who is continuing his research at Gentofte University Hospital.
