While the trade in elephant products is protected by national laws and CITES agreements to prevent further population declines, ivory poaching and illegal trade in ivory persists. For instance, in Thailand, it is illegal to trade ivory from African elephants; however, the law allows possession of ivory from Asian elephants if permission has been obtained from the authorities. It has been difficult to determine the necessary differences by tests alone.

"Many DNA-based techniques have been previously reported for this purpose, although these have a limit of detection not suitable for extremely degraded samples. Now, this new technique has made a great leap forward.

Blind testing of 304 samples resulted in 100% identification accuracy. It also resulted in correct assignment in the legal status of 227 highly degraded, aged ivories within the test cohort, thus underlining the high sensitivity of the process.
