A team, led by Toru Kondo at Hokkaido University's Institute of Genetic Medicine, has developed a powerful new method that does just that. Genes in cells have their own switches called promoters. A gene is switched off, or silenced, when its promoter is methylated. The team effectively wanted to turn on a switched-off gene. They combined a DNA repair mechanism, called MMEJ (microhomology-mediated end-joining), with CRISPR/Cas9. They cut out a methylated promoter using CRISPR/Cas9 and then inserted an unmethylated promoter with MMEJ, replacing the off-switch with an on-switch. The scientists used this tool on the neural cell gene OLIG2 and the embryonic stem cell gene NANOG to test its efficiency in cultured cells. Within five days, they found evidence that the genes were robustly expressed. When they turned on OLIG2 in cultured human stem cells, the cells differentiated to neurons in seven days with high efficiency. The scientists also found that their editing tool could be used to activate other silenced promoters. In addition, they found that the system didn't cause unwanted mutations in other non-targeted genes in the cells. The tool has wide potential to be used to manipulate gene expression, create genetic circuits, or to engineer cell fates.
