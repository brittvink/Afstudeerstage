In a first-of-its-kind study, Florida's critically endangered staghorn corals were surveyed to discover which ones can better withstand future heatwaves in the ocean. Insights from the study, led by scientists at Shedd Aquarium and the University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, help organizations working to restore climate-resilient reefs in Florida and provide a blueprint for the success of restoration projects globally.While this study was performed in Florida, there is growing interest among scientists and managers in surveying heat tolerance in other coral populations around the world," said Andrew Baker, professor in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology at the UM Rosenstiel School, and a co-author of the study. "Our study provides a template for other efforts to identify heat-tolerant corals and comes at a time when this knowledge can help transform approaches to stem the decline of corals due to climate change. Population censuses of heat tolerance are not only useful for scientists seeking to understand how and why corals vary in their thermal tolerance, but also to managers and policy makers guiding the future of reef restoration.

DNA samples were also taken to determine genetic factors underlying heat tolerance. The study's results showed significant variation in the heat tolerance of the 229 corals, with certain strains exhibiting higher heat tolerance that may translate to better survival in warming oceans.

"However, restoration and other conservation interventions must be optimized with heat tolerance in mind, in order to favor the survival of future reefs in warmer oceans. In this study, we conducted the first large-scale census of coral heat tolerance to identify thermotolerant individuals, which can be immediately used for various restoration techniques.

In this method, the corals proven to withstand warm waters through the study could be preferentially propagated and transferred to shallow or near-shore reefs that are more likely to experience high temperatures, whereas more sensitive fragments could be placed on deeper, offshore reefs that are less likely to heat up. As more of these tolerant corals are outplanted to reefs, they will help to boost the heat tolerance of the next generation of corals and increase the climate-resilience of natural populations.

Staghorn corals were once dominant on shallow reefs throughout the Caribbean, but have been decimated across their range since the early 1980s, making them a focal species for restoration efforts throughout the region, including Florida. Annually, tens of thousands of staghorn coral fragments are propagated and outplanted onto Florida's reefs by restoration practitioners, making Florida's staghorn corals the largest single-species coral restoration program in the world.
