The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.In a second linked study, a team of researchers assessed whether the use of heat not burn products helped Japanese workers to give up tobacco for good. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.They offered a smoking cessation programme to 158 users of conventional cigarettes (94) alone and/or heat not burn products (64) between November 2018 and April 2019. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.The workplace programme included prescription varenicrine or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), counselling, and information about stopping smoking. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.The quit rate was logged in August 2019, when 45 (29%) of the workers had successfully stopped using all tobacco products. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.Those who availed themselves of pharmacological support were more likely to quit than those who didn't (67% vs 11%) as were those who received counselling (69% vs 21%). The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.Analysis of the results showed that people who used varenicrine or NRT were 3 times more likely to stop smoking tobacco than those who didn't. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.But those who either used heat not burn products alone or in addition to conventional cigarettes (dual users) were 23% less likely than exclusive cigarette smokers to give up tobacco altogether, after accounting for age, tobacco dependence, previous quit attempts and use of pharmacological support. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.This too is an observational study, and the researchers acknowledge that their study was small and restricted to healthy men in just one workplace. Smoking status was also self-reported and assessed at a single time point, and successful quitters weren't asked how long they had stopped using tobacco. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.But they point out that those who used heat not burn products in their study did so because they thought they were less harmful than conventional cigarettes. The impact on lung cells of Heat not Burn products -- a hybrid between traditional cigarettes and electronic vaping devices -- may be no less harmful than that of conventional cigarettes, suggest the findings of a small comparative study, published online in the journal Thorax.It is possible that the rhetorical phrases by tobacco industries attract and make consumers misunderstand that changing from cigarettes to [heat not burn products] can provide a healthier environment for themselves and their surroundings," they suggest.
