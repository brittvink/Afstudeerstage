The joint development team of Professor Shibata (the University of Tokyo), JEOL Ltd. and Monash University succeeded in directly observing an atomic magnetic field, the origin of magnets (magnetic force), for the first time in the world. The observation was conducted using the newly developed Magnetic-field-free Atomic-Resolution STEM (MARS) (1). This team had already succeeded in observing the electric field inside atoms for the first time in 2012. However, since the magnetic fields in atoms are extremely weak compared with electric fields, the technology to observe the magnetic fields had been unexplored since the development of electron microscopes. This is an epoch-making achievement that will rewrite the history of microscope development.Electron microscopes have the highest spatial resolution among all currently used microscopes. However, in order to achieve ultra-high resolution so that atoms can be observed directly, we have to observe the sample by placing it in an extremely strong lens magnetic field. Therefore, atomic observation of magnetic materials that are strongly affected by the lens magnetic field such as magnets and steels had been impossible for many years. For this difficult problem, the team succeeded in developing a lens that has a completely new structure in 2019. Using this new lens, the team realized atomic observation of magnetic materials, which is not affected by the lens magnetic field. The team's next goal was to observe the magnetic fields of atoms, which are the origin of magnets (magnetic force), and they continued technological development to achieve the goal.

To observe the magnetic fields, they used the Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) method (2) at atomic resolution, which is an ultrahigh-resolution local electromagnetic field measurement method using a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) (3), developed by Professor Shibata et al. The results directly demonstrated that iron atoms themselves are small magnets (atomic magnet). The results also clarified the origin of magnetism (antiferromagnetism (4)) exhibited by hematite at the atomic level.

Currently, it is possible to directly observe atoms using an electron microscope. In an optical microscope, the spatial resolution is in principle limited to about one micrometer due to the light source (visible light). On the other hand, electron microscope is an instrument where this spatial resolution limit is exceeded by utilizing the wave nature of electrons. Therefore, it can be said that an electron microscope is an observation technology that applies the benefits of quantum mechanics in the most direct way.

Specifically, when an electron beam is injected in a sample, the force of the electromagnetic field that exists within the sample causes a slight trajectory change in the electron beam incident, and by measuring the difference in the electron beam intensity detected in each position of a split detector, the electromagnetic field can be measured. Since the spatial resolution of this method is basically determined by the size of the electron probe, observation of an electromagnetic field at atomic resolution is in principle possible using the DPC method.
