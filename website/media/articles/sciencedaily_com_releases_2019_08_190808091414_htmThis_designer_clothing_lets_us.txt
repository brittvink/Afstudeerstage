A new addition to your wardrobe may soon help you turn on the lights and music -- while also keeping you fresh, dry, fashionable, clean and safe from the latest virus that's going around.Purdue University researchers have developed a new fabric innovation that allows wearers to control electronic devices through clothing. A new addition to your wardrobe may soon help you turn on the lights and music -- while also keeping you fresh, dry, fashionable, clean and safe from the latest virus that's going around.It is the first time there is a technique capable to transform any existing cloth item or textile into a self-powered e-textile containing sensors, music players or simple illumination displays using simple embroidery without the need for expensive fabrication processes requiring complex steps or expensive equipment," said Ramses Martinez, an assistant professor in the School of Industrial Engineering and in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering in Purdue's College of Engineering. A new addition to your wardrobe may soon help you turn on the lights and music -- while also keeping you fresh, dry, fashionable, clean and safe from the latest virus that's going around.The technology is featured in the July 25 edition of Advanced Functional Materials.

"These self-powered e-textiles also constitute an important advancement in the development of wearable machine-human interfaces, which now can be washed many times in a conventional washing machine without apparent degradation.

The Purdue team says the RF-TENG technology is like having a wearable remote control that also keeps odors, rain, stains and bacteria away from the user.

"Having an interface with a machine that we are constantly wearing sounds like the most convenient approach for a seamless communication with machines and the Internet of Things.

The researchers are looking for partners to test and commercialize their technology.

It is one of the four themes of the yearlong celebration's Ideas Festival, designed to showcase Purdue as an intellectual center solving real-world issues.
