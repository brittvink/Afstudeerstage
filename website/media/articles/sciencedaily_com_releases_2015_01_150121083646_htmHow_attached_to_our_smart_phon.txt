Are we emotionally attached to our smart phones? That was the question scientists in the UK and Iceland hoped to answer in a forthcoming issue of the International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation.GÃ­sli Thorsteinsson of the University of Iceland in Reykjavik and Tom Page of Loughborough University explain how the emergence of devices such as the Apple iPhone in January 2007 gave users a computer in their pocket. The gadget not only allowed them to make phone calls and send text messages as previous phones had, but also gave users immediate access to social media and social network systems, such as Facebook and Twitter, allowed them to access their email quickly and seamlessly, provided access to the web, video clips, music files and a whole eco system of phone-based software, apps, all via a slick touch screen interface.

Thorsteinsson and Page wanted to know whether this attachment to one's smart phone has a serious emotional element. Are we emotionally attached to our smart phones? That was the question scientists in the UK and Iceland hoped to answer in a forthcoming issue of the International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation.Through a questionnaire given to 205 smart phone users in the age range 16 to 64 years from the UK, Hong Kong, China, Canada, Australia, Peru and the USA and through a case study the team has drawn a preliminary conclusion. They found that people do indeed grow emotionally attached to their smart phone, or at least, the connectivity and the technology that the device facilitates (Obviously, a lost or stolen phone can be replaced with the same model and a data backup restored to the replacement; the same cannot be said of a lost pet dog, for instance).
