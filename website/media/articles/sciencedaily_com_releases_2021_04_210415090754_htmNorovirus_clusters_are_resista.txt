Noroviruses are the leading cause of gastroenteritis around the world, with over 21 million cases each year in the United States alone. In 2018, Altan-Bonnet's team found that noroviruses can be transmitted to humans via membrane-enclosed packets that contain more than one virus. In the past, scientists thought that viruses spread through exposure to individual virus particles, but the 2018 study -- and others -- showed how membrane-enclosed clusters arrive at a human cell and release an army of viruses all at once. For the new study, Shuai, Altan-Bonnet and the study's first author Mengyang Zhang, a doctoral student co-advised through a GW/NIH Graduate Partnerships Program, looked at the behavior of these protected virus clusters in the environment. They found that the virus clusters could survive attempts to disinfect with detergent solutions or even UV light. Water treatment plants use UV light to kill noroviruses and other pathogens. These membrane-cloaked viruses are tricky," Shuai said. "Past research shows they can evade the body's immune system and that they are highly infectious. Our study shows these membrane enclosed viruses are also able to dodge efforts to kill them with standard disinfectants. According to the researchers, future studies must be done to find out if certain kinds of cleaning solutions or higher dosages of UV light would degrade the protective membrane and/or kill the viruses inside. Ultimately, the research could be used to devise more effective disinfection methods that could be used to clean surfaces at home, in restaurants and in places where norovirus can spread and cause outbreaks, like cruise ships. Our study's findings represent a step towards providing rigorous guidelines for pathogen control, particularly in our built environment, and public health protection," Altan-Bonnet said.
