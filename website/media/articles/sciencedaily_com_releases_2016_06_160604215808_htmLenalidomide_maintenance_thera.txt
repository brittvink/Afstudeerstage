The new study is a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (formerly Cancer and Leukemia Group B) (CALGB) with support from the NCI, Intergroupe Francophone du My√©lome (IFM), and the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA). It involved more than 1,200 participants. For this analysis, 605 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and treated with continuous lenalidomide (brand name Revlimid) following autologous stem cell transplant were compared to 604 patients who were treated with placebo or no maintenance. At seven years, 62% of those treated with maintenance lenalidomide had survived, compared to 50% of those in the control group. The benefit in overall survival was consistent across subgroups. Lenalidomide maintenance following autologous stem cell transplant can now be considered a standard of care for people with multiple myeloma," says Dr. McCarthy, senior author on the meta-analysis and Principal Investigator of the U.S. study, CALGB (Alliance) 100104. "The improvements over the last decade in terms of both survival and quality of life for patients with this disease are striking, and very encouraging. The study, "Lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance (MNTC) after high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in multiple myeloma (MM): A meta-analysis (MA) of overall survival (OS)," is ASCO 2016 abstract no. 8001 and will be discussed during the Hematologic Malignancies -- Plasma Cell Dyscrasia oral abstract session Friday, June 3.
