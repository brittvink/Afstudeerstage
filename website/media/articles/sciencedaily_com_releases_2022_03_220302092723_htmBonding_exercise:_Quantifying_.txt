The electrons of two hydrogen atoms are pulled in by opposing protons to form H2, for example, while other compositions of such electrostatic (Coulomb-mediated) attraction can result in more exotic molecular states.

These compound quasi-particles can be created via the excitation of an electron from the valence to the conduction band, with the negatively-charged conduction electron then electrostatically binding to the positively-charged vacancy (known as a hole) its excitation left in the valence band.

However, when things are reduced to two dimensions, the ways they can interact change, and important quantum effect can come into play. Monolayer semiconductors such as WS2 are introducing a materials revolution due to the novel properties uncovered by research like this.

This increased binding energy makes the biexcitons more accessible, even at room temperature, and introduces the possibility of using biexcitons flowing in novel materials as the basis for a range of low-energy future technologies.

Attempts have been made to investigate how much energy is required to separate the two excitons in a biexciton, the obvious way being a comparison between the energy of the bound and unbound excitons. Yet, this is not what is typically done. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.The Swinburne-led study has identified the optically-accessible biexciton in the atomically-thin TMDC tungsten disulphide (WS2). To unambiguously measure biexcitonic signatures, the team of researchers employed a specific sequence of ultrashort optical pulses with a precisely controlled phase relation and well-defined wave-vectors. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.By using multiple pulses with a high degree of precision we can selectively and directly probe the doubly excited biexciton state, while eliminating any contributions from singly excited exciton states," says corresponding author Prof Jeff Davis (Swinburne). A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.This ability to directly excite the biexciton is inaccessible to more common techniques such as photoluminescence spectroscopy," says Prof Davis. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.The technique the team used is known as 'two-quantum multidimensional coherent spectroscopy' (2Q-MDCS), which enables a direct experimental measurement of the biexciton binding energy. When the biexciton is observed using 2Q-MDCS, a signal from an exciton pair that is interacting but unbound is also generated, referred to as 'correlated excitons'. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.The energy difference between the biexciton peak and the correlated two-exciton peak is the best means to measure biexciton binding energy," Mitchell explains. "This was an exciting observation, since other spectroscopic techniques don't observe these correlated excitons. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.Techniques previously used to identify the biexciton are limited to measuring photons from the biexciton to exciton transition. These transitions may not reflect the precise energy of either relative to the ground state. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.In addition, the study identified the nature of the biexciton in monolayer WS2. The biexciton they observed was composed of two bright excitons with opposite spin, which in WS2 is referred to as a 'bright-bright intervalley' biexciton. In contrast, photoluminescence measurements reporting biexcitons in monolayer WS2 are unable to identify the specific excitons involved, but are typically assumed to involve bright exciton and one "dark" exciton, due to the rapid relaxation into these lower energy exciton states that don't absorb or emit light. A rare spectroscopy technique performed at Swinburne University of Technology directly quantifies the energy required to bind two excitons together, providing for the first time a direct measurement of the biexciton binding energy in WS2.The ability to accurately identify biexciton signatures in monolayer semiconductors may also play a key role in the development of quantum materials and quantum simulators. Higher-order electrostatic correlations provide a platform to construct coherent combinations of quantum states and potentially tune the interactions in order to realise quantum phases of matter that are still not well understood.
