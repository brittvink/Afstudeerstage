In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Researchers tracked 250,000 students from nearly every country in 250 massive open online courses (MOOCs) over 2 1/2 years in the study, "Scaling Up Behavioral Science Interventions in Online Education," published June 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Behavioral interventions are not a silver bullet," said Rene Kizilcec, assistant professor of information science and co-lead author. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Earlier studies showed that short, light-touch interventions at the beginning of a few select courses can increase persistence and completion rates," he said. "But when scaled up to over 250 different courses and a quarter of a million students, the intervention effects were an order of magnitude smaller. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The study was co-led by Justin Reich of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Yeomans of Imperial College London. The research was conducted on the edX and Open edX platforms, and edX has engaged in work to make the data available to institutional researchers to advance educational science at scale. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The 250 courses the researchers studied came from Harvard University, MIT and Stanford University. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Failure to complete online courses is a well-known and long-standing obstacle to virtual learning, particularly among disadvantaged communities and in developing nations -- where online education can be a key path to social advancement. The findings have added relevance with so much education around the world taking place online during the COVID-19 pandemic. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.My advice to instructors is to understand and address the specific challenges in their learning environment," Kizilcec said. "If students have issues with their internet connection, you can't help them overcome them with a self-regulation intervention. But if students need to go to bed on time in order to be awake for a morning lecture, or they need to plan ahead for when to start working on homework in order to have it ready to hand in, then a brief self-regulation intervention can in fact help students overcome these obstacles. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Previous, smaller-scale research, performed by Kizilcec and his co-authors as well as other scholars, found that goal-setting interventions such as writing out a list of intentions at the start of the class improved students' course completion rates. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.In this study, the researchers explored the effects of four interventions: In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.For the first three interventions, involving planning ahead, the researchers found that the approach was effective in boosting engagement for the first few weeks of the course, but the impact dwindled as the course progressed. The value-relevance intervention was effective in developing countries where student outcomes were significantly worse than others, but only in courses with a global achievement gap; in other courses, it actually had a negative impact in developing countries. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The researchers tested whether they could predict in which courses an achievement gap would occur, in order to decide where the intervention should be added, but found it extremely difficult to predict. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.Not knowing if it will help or hurt students in a given course is a big issue," he said. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The researchers attempted to use machine learning to predict which interventions might help which students, but found the algorithm was no better than assigning the same intervention to all students. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.It calls into question the potential of AI to provide personalized interventions to struggling students," Kizilcec said. "Approaches that focus on understanding what works best in individual environments and then tailoring interventions to those environments might be more effective. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The researchers said their findings suggest that future studies should be designed to consider and reveal the differences among students, in addition to studies assessing overall effects. In one of the largest educational field experiments ever conducted, a team co-led by a Cornell researcher found that promising interventions to help students complete online courses were not effective on a massive scale -- suggesting that targeted solutions are needed to help students in different circumstances or locations.The paper was co-authored by Christopher Dann of Carnegie Mellon University, Emma Brunskill of Stanford University, Glenn Lopez and Dustin Tingley of Harvard, Selen Turkay of the Queensland University of Technology and Joseph J.
