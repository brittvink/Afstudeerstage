Researchers from Japan and Indonesia have pioneered a new method for more accurately estimating the source of weak ground vibrations in areas where one tectonic plate is sliding under another in the sea. Applying the approach to Japan's Nankai Trough, the researchers were able to estimate previously unknown properties in the region, demonstrating the method's promise to help probe properties needed for better monitoring and understanding larger earthquakes along this and other plate interfaces.Episodes of small, often imperceptible seismic events known as tremors occur around the world and are particularly common in areas near volcanoes and subduction zones -- regions where one of the massive plates forming Earth's outer layers slides under another. Though they may be weak, studying these vibrations is important for estimating features of the associated tectonic plate boundaries and is necessary for detecting slipping among the plates that can be used to warn against larger earthquake events and tsunamis.

The novel approach involves a model that does not rely on a constant waveform and also considers the relationships between tremors detected at all possible pairs of monitoring stations.

Using this information, the team was then able to estimate how easily liquids can move through the deep fault. Known as permeability, this property is important for evaluating earthquake rupture processes and had never before been reported for the deep plate interface of the Nankai Trough.

"Our method can also be applied in other regions where tremor location estimation is difficult because of a complex geography to better obtain this vital information.
