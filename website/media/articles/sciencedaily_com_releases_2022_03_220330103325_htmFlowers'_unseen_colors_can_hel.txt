You can't see it, but different substances in the petals of flowers create a "bulls-eye" for pollinating insects, according to a Clemson University scientist whose research sheds light on chemical changes in flowers which helps them respond to environmental changes, including climate change, that might threaten their survival.Matthew H. Koski, an assistant professor of biological sciences in the Clemson College of Science, led a research team that studied the bright, yellow flowers of Argentina anserina -- a member of the rose family commonly known as silverweed -- to learn how pigments in the petals that are visible only in the ultraviolet spectrum play an integral part in the plant's plasticity; that is, its ability to quickly respond to a changing environment. The team also included Clemson researchers Lindsay M. Finnell, Elizabeth Leonard and Nishanth Tharayil.

You can't see it, but different substances in the petals of flowers create a "bulls-eye" for pollinating insects, according to a Clemson University scientist whose research sheds light on chemical changes in flowers which helps them respond to environmental changes, including climate change, that might threaten their survival.Insects -- pollinators, for example -- see in the ultraviolet spectrum," he continued. "So, flowers that reflect or absorb ultraviolet wavelengths give (to pollinators) the perception of different colors that we can't see. I've been fascinated with uncovering what these UV signals might be doing functionally with respect to pollination. When I thought about the trait of interest in ultraviolet absorption, it is biochemistry. It's a biochemical trait that leads to different perceptions of UV absorption and reflectance.

He said this creates an overall "bulls-eye" effect that guides insects in their search for pollen.

They found that flowers at different altitudes adapt to their environments by producing differing amounts of UV-blocking or UV-absorbing chemicals.

This is a critical step in understanding how organisms adapt to survive change.

"The process of evolution, where you're getting changes in the genetic code over time, is thought to proceed more slowly than just responding plastically to environmental change. You can't see it, but different substances in the petals of flowers create a "bulls-eye" for pollinating insects, according to a Clemson University scientist whose research sheds light on chemical changes in flowers which helps them respond to environmental changes, including climate change, that might threaten their survival.Koski said that one question raised by the research is whether plastic responses to environmental situations are adaptive. Do they offer any advantage to an organism, or are they changes in how a trait develops because of the environment without impacting plant fitness?

The research could also be important for agriculture, he said, because some of the same UV-sensitive pigments at work in silverweed are also present in commercial crops such as mustard and sunflowers.

"One thing to think about is that we often don't know all the details of what colors are perceived by pollinators, and how that could be changing with the seasons. Just because things may look very similar to us, they may actually be very diverse to pollinators and could attract a different suite of pollinators than we expect.
