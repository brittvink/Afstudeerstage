This has already provided scientists with one of the most accurate  measurements of what's called the oblateness of the sun, which is the  difference between the diameter from pole to pole and the equatorial  diameter. With the new data obtained during the Venus Transit on June  5-6, 2012, the RHESSI team hopes to improve the knowledge of the exact  shape of the sun and provide a more accurate measure of the diameter  than has previously been obtained.For one thing, the sharpness of the Venus disk as it crosses the sun  will help determine the detailed optical properties of the telescope and  calibrate the instrument’s so-called plate scale, the exact angular  size of each pixel. With this improvement in hand, RHESSI can  re-calibrate its already highly accurate observations of the sun's  horizon.  To further this aim, the science team has set the instrument  to look at 64 pixels across the sun's limb, rather than its customary  four.The RHESSI team has hopes that they may be able to provide an unprecedentedly accurate measurement of the sun's size.With ten years of solar diameter measurements as well as observations of  the Venus Transit in 2004 – a time when the sun's activity was  decreasing toward solar minimum, as opposed to now when the solar  activity is increasing as it moves toward solar maximum predicted for  2013 – the science team hopes to compare the sun's size then and now to  see if perhaps it varies with the solar cycle.
