A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.CJD is a rare but devastating disease that causes brain damage and for which there is currently no licensed treatment. It is always fatal and most patients sadly die within a few months of diagnosis. A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.Researchers at the MRC Prion Unit at UCL have developed a monoclonal antibody, called PRN100, which was given to six UCLH patients with CJD between October 2018 and July 2019. A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.The results, published in the Lancet Neurology, show the treatment is safe and able to access the brain. In three patients, disease progression appeared to stabilise when dosing levels were in target range. A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.Given the small number of patients treated, researchers say the findings should be regarded as preliminary and further studies are needed to draw more comprehensive conclusions.

A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.UCLH provided the PRN100 drug to patients under a "Specials" exemption, rather than a regulated clinical trial. A "Specials" exemption permits a healthcare professional to treat an individual patient with an unlicensed drug when their special clinical needs cannot be met by a licensed product on the market. A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.Three of the six patients were able to consent to receiving the PRN100 antibody themselves. The other three did not have the capacity to consent, so with the support of their families, UCLH sought the opinion of a judge in the Court of Protection in order to proceed. A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.UCLH created an oversight group, independent of the MRC Prion Unit at UCL and treating clinicians, to consider the numerous and complex clinical, safety, legal and ethical issues arising from the potential use of this unlicensed treatment. The group comprised world-leading experts from a range of disciplines and met regularly with lawyers and patient advocates from the Cure CJD Campaign.

A world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), developed by scientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Prion Unit at UCL, has shown "very encouraging" early results following its use in six patients at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust.Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and cruel disease which rapidly destroys the brain and for which there is currently no cure or licensed treatment. It was extremely important to us to find a way through the many challenges arising from the potential use of this novel treatment in order to offer it to a small group of patients.
