For the study, more than 1,000 patients 18 years and older were evaluated and asked about pain, family history, physical and psychological limitations and treatment history. They also were asked about childhood pain. The authors hypothesized that adult patients who reported having pain in childhood are more likely to experience pain of greater severity that is neuropathic in nature and meets clinical criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Results showed that one in six new adult pain patients said they had a history of chronic pain in childhood and they were predominantly young females. Their pain tended to be more widespread, and neuropathic, likely fibromyalgia, in contrast with subjects who denied having childhood pain. Patients who experienced childhood pain also showed higher levels of anxiety and worse functional status.
