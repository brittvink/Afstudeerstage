It is common knowledge that there would be no oxygen on Earth were it not for sunlight; the key component in photosynthesis. Now researchers have made the surprising discovery that oxygen is also produced without sunlight, possibly deep below the ocean surface. There is more going on in the deep, dark ocean waters than you may think: Uncountable numbers of invisible microorganisms go about their daily lives in the water columns, and now researchers have discovered that some of them produce oxygen in an unexpected way.The study is led by Beate Kraft and Donald E. Canfield from University of Southern Denmark and published in the journal Science. Contributing authors are Nico Jehmlich, Morten Larsen, Laura Bristow, Martin KÃ¶nneke and Bo Thamdrup. Beate Kraft is an assistant professor at Department of Biology. Her focus is on microbial physiology and biochemistry, and her research is supported by a Villum Young Investigator Grant. Don E. Canfield is Professor of Ecology at the Department of Biology and Danish Institute for Andvance Study chair of Biology.

There is more going on in the deep, dark ocean waters than you may think: Uncountable numbers of invisible microorganisms go about their daily lives in the water columns, and now researchers have discovered that some of them produce oxygen in an unexpected way.Oxygen is vital for life on Earth, and is mainly produced by plants, algae and cyanobacteria via photosynthesis. A few microbes are known to make oxygen without sunlight, but so far they have only been discovered in very limited quantities and in very specific habitats. It is common knowledge that there would be no oxygen on Earth were it not for sunlight; the key component in photosynthesis.

For this they need oxygen, so it has been a long standing puzzle why they are also very abundant in waters where there is no oxygen," says biologist Beate Kraft, adding: It is common knowledge that there would be no oxygen on Earth were it not for sunlight; the key component in photosynthesis.
