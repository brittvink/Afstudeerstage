The muskrat, a stocky brown rodent the size of a Chihuahua -- with a tail like a mouse, teeth like a beaver and an exceptional ability to bounce back from rapid die-offs -- has lived for thousands of years in one of Earth's largest freshwater deltas, in northeastern Alberta, Canada.Today, this delta lies within one of the largest swaths of protected land in North America: a national park five times the size of Yellowstone that's home to the planet's biggest herd of free-roaming bison and the last natural nesting ground for the endangered whooping crane. It's also central to the culture and livelihoods of Indigenous peoples, including the Mikisew Cree First Nation, Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and MÃ©tis Local 125.

"Climate change and dams have changed the ability of this exemplar species -- and many plants, animals and people who depend on the same ecosystem -- to thrive in this large area. The muskrat, a stocky brown rodent the size of a Chihuahua -- with a tail like a mouse, teeth like a beaver and an exceptional ability to bounce back from rapid die-offs -- has lived for thousands of years in one of Earth's largest freshwater deltas, in northeastern Alberta, Canada.The research comes on the heels of a draft finding from the United Nations that Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park -- the park and World Heritage Site that contains the Peace-Athabasca Delta -- is likely in danger from threats related to governance as well as hydropower and oil sands development upstream of the delta. Previous research has implicated climate change as a driver of long-term drying in the delta and hydroelectric dams on the Peace River as a cause of reduced flooding. The muskrat, a stocky brown rodent the size of a Chihuahua -- with a tail like a mouse, teeth like a beaver and an exceptional ability to bounce back from rapid die-offs -- has lived for thousands of years in one of Earth's largest freshwater deltas, in northeastern Alberta, Canada.Our results speak to the impacts on the biotic environment of long-term drying -- whatever the cause -- and this has implications for science and environmental policy," said Stanford hydrologist Steve Gorelick, co-principal investigator of the study and a senior fellow at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.

But in recent decades the booms -- and the area of the delta inhabited by muskrats during wet years -- have been shrinking. The authors found the most recent year of net population increase after flooding, 2014, was less productive than any such growth year going back to the 1970s.

"During a big flood, a lot of muskrats will drown. Some will get swept up into trees and stay put," said lead study author Ellen Ward, who worked on the research as a PhD student in Earth system science at Stanford. "But some will stay in the water, either floating or clinging to debris, and get swept along quite far.

They graze intensively on plants near the shore, strongly influencing plant life in the area and providing prey for fox, lynx, mink and other predators.

"They're a bit of a canary in a coal mine," said Hadly, the Paul S. and Billie Achilles Professor in Environmental Biology and a senior fellow at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. The muskrat, a stocky brown rodent the size of a Chihuahua -- with a tail like a mouse, teeth like a beaver and an exceptional ability to bounce back from rapid die-offs -- has lived for thousands of years in one of Earth's largest freshwater deltas, in northeastern Alberta, Canada.In one flood year, DNA from a pair of closely related muskrats turned up nearly 25 miles apart, suggesting that the animals can roam or be carried far in search of suitable habitat beyond their place of birth. During dry years, the authors found population size and density decreased while the number of individuals migrating through a given location increased, suggesting overcrowding in remaining patches of habitat drives long and perilous migrations in search of viable territory.

"Our modeling accounts for all stages of muskrat life: their travels, their diet, their reproduction and the many ways they can and do perish. They can freeze, drown, starve, be eaten or eat each other," Gorelick said.

"Even when the population increases to the huge sizes that we see in peak years, there is not as much genetic diversity in the population as we would expect," explained co-lead study author Katherine Solari, a postdoctoral research fellow in biology.

"You can't just go to one lake and say, 'We're going to protect all the fish and muskrats here,' because it will be completely different next year," Hadly said. "It challenges us to think of how we preserve the dynamism in this landscape in the face of an altered hydrology and climate.
