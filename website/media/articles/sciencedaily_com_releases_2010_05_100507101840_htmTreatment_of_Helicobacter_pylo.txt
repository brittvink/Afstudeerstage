Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a well-accepted initial therapy in cases of localized (stage ⅠE) low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma associated with H. pylori infection. However, there are no treatment guidelines for the management of H. pylori-negative low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma.Retrospectively reviewing the clinical outcome and clinicopathologic factors of stage ⅠE H. pylori-negative low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma cases from August 1998 to June 2009, a research team from South Korea analyzed the treatment outcome of H. pylori-negative low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a well-accepted initial therapy in cases of localized (stage ⅠE) low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma associated with H. pylori infection. However, there are no treatment guidelines for the management of H. pylori-negative low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma.Their study will be published on May 7, 2010 in the World Journal of Gastroenterology . Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a well-accepted initial therapy in cases of localized (stage ⅠE) low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma associated with H. pylori infection. However, there are no treatment guidelines for the management of H. pylori-negative low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma.Their results indicated that H. pylori eradication therapy may be an initial treatment option for localized H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma. Their study adds information which helps in the establishment of strategies for patients with localized H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.
