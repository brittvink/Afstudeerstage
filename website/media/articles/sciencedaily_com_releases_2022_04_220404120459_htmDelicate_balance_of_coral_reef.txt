An international team of researchers, including several from the University of Hawai'i (UH) at M?noa, has quantified five critical ecological processes on more than 500 coral reefs worldwide to understand how these processes relate to each other, what may distinguish the most functional reefs, and what that means for our management of reef functioning.Their work, published today in Nature Ecology and Evolution, demonstrates that five key functions performed by fish communities-the removal of algae, predation, biomass production, and the cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus- are inherently interconnected. As such, while the performance of these processes is influenced by the community structure of reef fishes on any given reef, no reef can maximize each of the five processes simultaneously.

They host a high diversity of species and are very productive. Climate change and local threats, such as overfishing, have caused a stark decline in coral reefs worldwide, leaving scientists questioning whether future generations will still encounter healthy, 'functional' coral reefs. But what exactly makes a coral reef 'functional'? An international team of researchers, including several from the University of Hawai'i (UH) at M?noa, has quantified five critical ecological processes on more than 500 coral reefs worldwide to understand how these processes relate to each other, what may distinguish the most functional reefs, and what that means for our management of reef functioning.Imagine a coral reef fish community swirling with small fishes that feed on algae," explained Nina Schiettekatte, the lead author, former doctoral student at the Center for Island Research and Environmental Observatory and postdoctoral fellow at UH M?noa's Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB). "This community will be characterized by high algal consumption and high biomass production, but it will have low phosphorus cycling because these species excrete very little phosphorus.

The researchers gained this knowledge by collecting data from individual fishes and combining it with a large dataset on fish communities worldwide.

"Previously, most researchers have used the biomass of a fish community as a proxy for coral reef functioning but we show that it is critical to look beyond biomass and really disentangle the different components of functioning to understand how reefs work.

Surprisingly, they found that no single species was consistently important across its range, but half of all species were important in at least one location.

"But there are many local super heroes.

"Since we cannot maximize all aspects of functioning, we clearly need to develop a more nuanced approach to conserving coral reefs that considers local species, ecosystem dynamics, and stakeholder needs.
