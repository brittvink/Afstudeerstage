The exploration of dark matter, and the detection of gravitational waves from the very early Universe is key to developing our collective knowledge of fundamental physics. A new concept has been developed that has the potential to assist new instruments in the investigation of fundamental science topics such as gravitational waves and dark matter.The new paper, written by Dr Rustin Nourshargh, Dr Samuel Lellouch and colleagues from the School of Physics and Astronomy, describes how synchronisation of the input pulses, to realise a spatially resolved circulating pulse within the optical cavity, can facilitate a large momentum transfer without the need for drastic improvements in available laser power. A new concept has been developed that has the potential to assist new instruments in the investigation of fundamental science topics such as gravitational waves and dark matter.Investigating dark matter and gravitational waves will not only facilitate a better understanding of the Universe's history, but will also drive new ideas for improving the future sensitivity of atom interferometers. This will also be relevant to further exploiting atom interferometry in practical applications, such as providing new tools for navigation through enabling increased resilience against loss of GPS signals.
