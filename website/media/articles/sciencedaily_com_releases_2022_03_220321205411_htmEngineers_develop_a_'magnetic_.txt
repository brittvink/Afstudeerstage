The next phase of the research will investigate the effectiveness of the device in navigating lungs taken from a cadaver. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Limits of existing technology  Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Currently, doctors use an instrument called a bronchoscope to carry out an examination of the lungs and air passages. The procedure involves passing a flexible tube-like instrument, about 3.5 to 4 millimetres in diameter, through the nose or mouth and into the bronchial passages. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Because of its size, the bronchoscope can only travel as far as the upper levels of the bronchial tree. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.To delve deeper into the lungs, a catheter or fine tube -- measuring about 2 millimetres in diameter -- is passed through the bronchoscope and then into the smaller tubes of the lungs. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.But doctors are limited in how they can move a bronchoscope, making it difficult to navigate the instrument and the catheter to where they are needed. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.The magnetic tentacle robot, however, has been developed to be much more manoeuvrable and uses a robotic guidance system that is personalised for each procedure. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Professor Pietro Valdastri, Director of the STORM Lab who supervised the research, said: "A magnetic tentacle robot or catheter that measures 2 millimetres and whose shape can be magnetically controlled to conform to the bronchial tree anatomy can reach most areas of the lung, and would be an important clinical tool in the investigation and treatment of possible lung cancer and other lung diseases. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Our system uses an autonomous magnetic guidance system which does away for the need for patients to be X-rayed while the procedure is carried out. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Innovative technology  Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.To develop the robotic system, the research team had to overcome two major challenges. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Firstly, they had to make a device that was small, flexible and able to navigate the twists and turns of the anatomy of the bronchial tree. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Secondly, they needed an autonomous system to guide the magnetic tentacle robot into place, doing away with the need for a doctor to manually manoeuvre an instrument into place, which often involves the patient being exposed to x-rays, and can be technically challenging for medical staff.

The segments were made of a soft elastomeric or rubber-like material which had been impregnated with tiny magnetic particles. Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.Because of the presence of the magnetic particles, the interlinked segments can move somewhat independently under the effect of an external magnetic field. The result is a magnetic tentacle robot which is highly flexible, able to shape shift and small enough to avoid snagging on anatomical structures in the lungs.

Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs -- to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.The route through the bronchial tree is planned from pre-operative scans of a patient's lungs and programmed into the robotic system. As the magnets outside of the patient move, they develop forces on the magnetic particles in the segments of the catheter, causing them to change shape or direction -- enabling the robot to be manoeuvred through the lungs and to a site of a suspicious lesion.
