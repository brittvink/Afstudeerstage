Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.A new study, led by researchers from the University of Waterloo details three games created for level three and higher semi-autonomous vehicles. The researchers also made suggestions for many exciting types of in-car games for future exploration. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.Level three and higher semi-autonomous vehicles are those that have, at minimum, environmental detection capabilities and can make informed decisions for themselves.

"You could use time spent in commute to read a book, watch a movie, get ahead on work, or browse the internet. Still, not everything you do has to be all isolated. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.You will be able to play games with other people in autonomous vehicles nearby when the car is driving itself. The games will be imposed on top of the actual world, so drivers won't have to take their eyes off the road. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.Self-driving cars have many intelligent technologies that help to keep them safe, and the researchers envision that in the future, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and heads-up displays (HUDs) will also become standard features. V2V enables cars to let each other know where they are relative to each other on the road, and HUDs on the windshield keep drivers aware of the car's speed and road conditions. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.In developing the three games, the researchers first undertook an extensive literature review to identify gaps in previous research done about autonomous vehicles and found that not much attention has been given to cross-car games. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.They then developed a virtual reality (VR) driving simulator to render the car cabin, outside environment, and roadway with artificially controlled cars and intelligent computer-controlled players. The VR driving simulator is designed as a framework to enable rapid prototyping of in-car games that leverage future technologies like V2V, full window HUDs, head tracking, and different input methods. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.Twelve participants evaluated the three cross-car games. They played the games, with occasional take-over tasks, completed the Player Experience Inventory questionnaire to measure player experience, and answered questions in a semi-structured interview. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.Overall, the participants rated the games highly in immersion, there was a positive response to the incorporation of HUDs in the games, and the different game styles did not significantly impact the take-over task completion time. All games were popular for different reasons," said Lakier, a member of Waterloo's Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab.

So, for example, they said they could form impromptu relationships with other people on the road. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.The study, Cross-Car, Multiplayer Games for Semi-Autonomous Driving, was recently presented at the Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play. Researchers have designed multiplayer games occupants of autonomous vehicles can play with other players in nearby self-driving cars.The study was co-authored by Lakier, his supervisor Professor Daniel Vogel, Associate Professor Lennart Nacke, and Takeo Igarashi, a professor from the University of Tokyo.
