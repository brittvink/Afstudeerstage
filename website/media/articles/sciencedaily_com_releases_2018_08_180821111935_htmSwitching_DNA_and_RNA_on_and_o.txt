In this work, the authors employ computational molecular modelling to study the polarisation switching of DNA and RNA using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach. To do so, they model the five nucleobases which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The authors also make an interesting discovery: that the minimum electric field required for switching the polarisation of a nucleobase is inversely proportional to the ratio of the topological polar surface area (TPSA) to the total surface area (TSA) of a nucleobase. This work may, therefore, also provide valuable insights for understanding the possible existence of ferroelectricity in biomaterials; further, the observed switching mechanism and ferroelectrical properties of DNA and RNA nucleobases could inform the future development of DNA and RNA-based nanomaterials and electronic devices.
