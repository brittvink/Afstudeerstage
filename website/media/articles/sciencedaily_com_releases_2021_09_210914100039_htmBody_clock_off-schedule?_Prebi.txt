Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.Rats that ate prebiotics more quickly realigned their sleep-wake cycles and core body temperature (which can also be thrown off when internal clocks are off) and resisted the alterations in gut flora that often come with stress. Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.This is one of the first studies to connect consuming prebiotics to specific bacterial changes that not only affect sleep but also the body's response to circadian rhythm disruption," said Thompson. Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.The study also takes a critical step forward in answering the question: How can simply ingesting a starch impact how we sleep and feel? Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.The researchers found that those on the prebiotic diet hosted an abundance of several health-promoting microbes, including Ruminiclostridium 5 (shown in other studies to reduce fragmented sleep) and Parabacteroides distasonis. Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.They also had a substantially different "metabolome," the collection of metabolic byproducts churned out by bacteria in the gut. Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.Put simply: The animals that ingested the prebiotics hosted more good bacteria, which in turn produced metabolites that protected them from something akin to jet lag. Whether it's from jetting across time zones, pulling all-nighters at school or working the overnight shift, chronically disrupting our circadian rhythm -- or internal biological clocks -- can take a measurable toll on everything from sleep, mood and metabolism to risk of certain diseases, mounting research shows.Are supplements worthwhile?

"But if you know you are going to come into a challenge, you could take a look at some of the prebiotics that are available. Just realize that they are not customized yet, so it might work for you but it won't work for your neighbor.
