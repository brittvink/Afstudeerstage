Working in a mouse model of the disease, the team confirmed that chemotherapy-killed ovarian cancer cells induce surrounding immune cells called macrophages to release a surge of chemicals. Together, these chemicals, known as cytokines and lipid mediators, create an environment conducive to tumor growth and survival. Conventional cancer therapy is a double-edged sword -- the very treatment meant to control cancer is also helping it to survive and grow," said Gartung, a postdoctoral fellow in BIDMC's Department of Pathology. "To prevent tumor recurrence after therapy, it is critical to neutralize the inherent tumor-promoting activity of therapy-generated debris. Next, the team showed that a newly synthesized anti-inflammatory drug called PTUPB -- specifically designed to target the chemical pathways that lead to cytokines and lipid mediators -- blocks the debris-stimulated surge of tumor-promoting chemicals by macrophages. In addition, the scientists found that PTUPB prolonged survival in mice bearing ovarian tumors and suppressed debris-stimulated tumor growth. The role of these chemotherapy-induced cytokines and lipids is underappreciated and poorly characterized, and ovarian cancer patients may benefit from suppressing their release," said Panigrahy, Assistant Professor of Pathology and a Scientist at the Cancer Center at BIDMC. "Further research is needed but, our results indicate that PTUPB may complement conventional cancer therapies by acting as a 'surge protector' against cell debris-stimulated tumor growth.
