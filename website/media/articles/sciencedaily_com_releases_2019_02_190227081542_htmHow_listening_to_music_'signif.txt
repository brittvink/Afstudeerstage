The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.Psychologists from the University of Central Lancashire, University of GÃ¤vle in Sweden and Lancaster University investigated the impact of background music on performance by presenting people with verbal insight problems that are believed to tap creativity. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.They found that background music "significantly impaired" people's ability to complete tasks testing verbal creativity -- but there was no effect for background library noise. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.For example, a participant was shown three words (e.g., dress, dial, flower), with the requirement being to find a single associated word (in this case "sun") that can be combined to make a common word or phrase (i.e., sundress, sundial and sunflower). The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.The researchers used three experiments involving verbal tasks in either a quiet environment or while exposed to: The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.Dr Neil McLatchie of Lancaster University said: "We found strong evidence of impaired performance when playing background music in comparison to quiet background conditions. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.Researchers suggest this may be because music disrupts verbal working memory. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.The third experiment -- exposure to music with familiar lyrics- impaired creativity regardless of whether the music also boosted mood, induced a positive mood, was liked by the participants, or whether participants typically studied in the presence of music. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.However, there was no significant difference in performance of the verbal tasks between the quiet and library noise conditions. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.Researchers say this is because library noise is a "steady state" environment which is not as disruptive. The popular view that music enhances creativity has been challenged by researchers who say it has the opposite effect.To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content (no lyrics, familiar lyrics or unfamiliar lyrics), consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving.
