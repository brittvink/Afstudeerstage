Mathematicians at the Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have developed a mathematical algorithm to decipher the rotational dynamics of twisting particles in large complex systems from the X-ray scattering patterns observed in highly sophisticated X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments.These experiments -- designed to study the properties of suspensions and solutions of colloids, macromolecules, and polymers -- have been established as key scientific drivers to many of the ongoing coherent light source upgrades occurring within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The new mathematical methods, developed by the CAMERA team of Zixi Hu, Jeffrey Donatelli, and James Sethian, have the potential to reveal far more information about the function and properties of complex materials than was previously possible.

The sizes of these random fluctuations depend on the shape and structure of the materials and contain information about dynamics, with applications across molecular biology, drug discovery, and materials science.

A detector picks up the resulting speckle patterns, which contain several tiny fluctuations in the signal that encode detailed information about the dynamics of the observed system. To capitalize on this capability, the upcoming coherent light source upgrades at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source (ALS), Argonne's Advanced Photon Source (APS), and SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source are all planning some of the world's most advanced XPCS experiments, taking advantage of the unprecedented coherence and brightness.

A workhorse technique to extract dynamical information from XPCS is to compute what's known as the temporal autocorrelation, which measures how the pixels in the speckle patterns change after a certain passage of time. The autocorrelation function stitches the still images together, just as an old-time movie comes to life as closely related postcard images fly by.

However, no previous algorithms were capable of extracting "rotational diffusion" information about how structures spin and rotate -- information that is critical to understanding the function and dynamical properties of a physical system. Getting to this hidden information is a major challenge.

Extracting rotational diffusion was a key goal, and Hu, a UC Berkeley math graduate student; Donatelli, the CAMERA Lead for Mathematics; and Sethian, Professor of Mathematics at UC Berkeley and CAMERA Director, teamed up to tackle the problem head on. Mathematicians at the Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have developed a mathematical algorithm to decipher the rotational dynamics of twisting particles in large complex systems from the X-ray scattering patterns observed in highly sophisticated X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments.The result of their work is a powerful new mathematical and algorithmic approach to extract rotational information, now working in 2D and easily scalable to 3D. With remarkably few images (less than 4,000), the method can easily predict simulated rotational diffusion coefficients to within a few percent. Details of the algorithm were published August 18 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mathematicians at the Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have developed a mathematical algorithm to decipher the rotational dynamics of twisting particles in large complex systems from the X-ray scattering patterns observed in highly sophisticated X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments.The key idea is to go beyond the standard autocorrelation function, instead seeking the extra information about rotation contained in angular-temporal cross-correlation functions, which compare how pixels change in both time and space. This is a major jump in mathematical complexity: simple data matrices turn into 4-way data tensors, and the theory relating the rotational information to these tensors involves advanced harmonic analysis, linear algebra, and tensor analysis. To relate the desired rotational information to the data, Hu developed a highly sophisticated mathematical model that describes how the angular-temporal correlations behave as a function of the rotational dynamics from this new complex set of equations.

"There was information related to both static structures and to dynamic properties, and these properties needed to be systematically exploited to build a consistent framework. Taken together, they present a wonderful opportunity to weave together many mathematical ideas. Getting this approach to pick up useful information out of what seems at first glance to be awfully noisy was great fun.

To tackle this challenge, the team built on Donatelli's earlier work on Multi-Tiered Iterative Projections (M-TIP), which is designed to solve complex inverse problems where the goal is to find the input that produces an observed output. The idea of M-TIP is to break a complex problem into subparts, using the best inversion/pseudoinversion you can for each subpart, and iterate through those subsolutions until they converge to a solution that solves all parts of the problem.
