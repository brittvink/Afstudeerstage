The researchers transitioned much of the material from their second-year pathophysiology course -- including nearly all live presentations by faculty -- into prerecorded videos and a suggested schedule of study. The faculty also scheduled daily interactive sessions where students could apply their learning. Some sessions were mandatory, but most were not. Student performance, as measured by in-house exams and high-stakes standardized exams, has not declined, and in many respects is improving. Moreover, evaluations of the course suggest that most students appreciate the flexibility and independence available with this approach," the researchers wrote. Thomas Pressley, PhD, professor of physiology at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, will present "Flipping the course: Independent study of online videos and interactive sessions in a medical pathophysiology course" in a poster session on Tuesday, June 19 at the Madison Concourse Hotel.
