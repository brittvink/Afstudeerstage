As the search for a hypothetical, unseen planet far, far beyond Neptune's orbit continues, research by a team of the University of Arizona provides additional support for the possible existence of such a world and narrows the range of its parameters and location.Led by Renu Malhotra, a Regents' Professor of Planetary Sciences in the UA's Lunar and Planetary Lab, the team found that the four Kuiper Belt Objects with the longest known orbital periods revolve around the Sun in patterns most readily explained by the presence of a hypothetical "Planet Nine" approximately ten times the mass of Earth. Malhotra is presenting the results at the joint 48th meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society and 11th European Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, California.

Referred to as "extreme KBOs" (eKBOs) by the authors, all of these have extremely large orbital eccentricities, in other words, they get very close to the Sun at one point on their orbital journey, only to swing far out into space once they pass the Sun, on long elliptical orbits that take these strange mini worlds hundreds of AUs away from the Sun.

An example of this would be one KBO traveling around the Sun once while another takes twice as long, or three times as long, or four times as long etc., but not, say, 2.7 times as long.

This clustering of orbital parameters of the most distant KBOs suggested a large, planetary size body shepherding their orbits.

In this scenario, orbits whose orderly parameters appear as testimony to the stabilizing influence of an unseen planet may in fact be in the process of deterioration but haven't been observed long enough for it to show.
