Delivering two federally approved immunity-altering drugs together significantly extended the lives of mice injected with human ovarian cancer cells, an early proof-of-concept experiment that may advance treatment for the most deadly -- although rare -- gynecologic malignancy in humans, according to scientists at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center who performed the research.The combination treatment appears to improve survival by changing the natural ratio of different types of immune system "clean up" cells called macrophages, a therapy target that's received less attention than other immune system components but could hold promise for patients with various types of malignancies, the investigators say.

Delivering two federally approved immunity-altering drugs together significantly extended the lives of mice injected with human ovarian cancer cells, an early proof-of-concept experiment that may advance treatment for the most deadly -- although rare -- gynecologic malignancy in humans, according to scientists at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center who performed the research.Over the past decade, Zahnow notes, several cancer clinical trials have shown promise for a class of drugs known as epigenetic therapies, which remove chemical groups on DNA and proteins that affect the activity of cancer-related genes. Although the drugs mainly battle cancer by returning the function of cancer-fighting genes that have become suppressed by the disease itself, researchers have also discovered that the drugs may trigger an anti-viral, immune response that may help the body attack tumors.

These agents also affect the immune system, with studies showing that they alter the makeup of immune cell populations in tumor microenvironments.

Over the course of several weeks, the rodents developed ascites, or fluid collections in their abdomens full of cancer and immune cells, as a consequence of cancer progression. By sampling the fluid weekly, the researchers obtained a window on tumor growth and immune activity simultaneously over time.

Currently, AZA is FDA approved to treat a bone marrow disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome, and DFMO is FDA-approved for African sleeping sickness.

However, mice treated with the combination therapy lived about 25% longer, to 59 days.

However, there were two exceptions.

Previous studies have shown that M1 macrophages can protect against tumor growth and progression, while M2 macrophages promote tumor growth.

When the researchers blocked the activity of all macrophages with an antibody that inhibits them, the combination therapy lost its survival effect, demonstrating the importance of this M1 population of immune cells to fight the cancer.

"DFMO is so nontoxic that it also could provide a buffer in patients' drug regimens that would help them add other potent medications with more significant side effects," says Zahnow. Such regimens might include medications that could further offset the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages as a patient's disease returns or progresses, hallmarks of ovarian cancer.
