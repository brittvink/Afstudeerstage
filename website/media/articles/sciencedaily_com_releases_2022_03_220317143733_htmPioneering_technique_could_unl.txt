Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.Members of the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, based at the University of Leicester, used proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as a 'bridge' to degrade proteins implicated in cancer. Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.Scientists can manipulate the effectiveness of treatments by making changes to elements of this PROTAC bridge. Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.This new study, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, describes how Leicester researchers applied a previously-described protein degradation technique known as PROTACs to degrade histone deacetylation enzymes (HDACs) in a more targeted way than ever before. Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.HDACs play an important role in gene regulation, in which genes are switched 'on' and 'off', and are associated with a range of diseases, including cancer as well as various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.Using this pioneering technique to target specific structures within cancerous cells could increase the potency and selectivity of new and existing drugs, meaning patients would require lower systemic exposure to drug treatments leading to a reduction in harmful side-effects to patients.
