Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.We are hopeful that by making the connection between Lp(a) and CAC as dual risk drivers, we can raise awareness in the medical community and improve earlier heart attack prevention for these patients," said cardiologist Parag Joshi, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Our data may also expedite the development of treatments designed specifically for this high-risk population," said Dr. Joshi, a member of the Clinical Heart and Vascular Center at UT Southwestern. Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Approximately one in six people in the U.S. have high Lp(a), a type of bad cholesterol whose levels are driven largely by one's genes. Coronary artery calcium, known as CAC, is a marker of plaque deposits around the heart. Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.The team of researchers, which included researchers from Emory University, found that participants with combined high Lp(a) and high CAC had a 22% 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke, compared with a 10-15% 10-year risk in patients who had either risk factor alone. Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Investigators identified three distinct risk-related trends: Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.The findings are online in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) and will appear in the March print edition.

Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Establishing the connection between Lp(a) and CAC means we can move to the important next phase of research, which will be defining and personalizing early screening protocols to identify patients at high risk of heart attack," said Dr. Joshi, whose research focuses on assessing risk for heart attack and stroke, CAC, cholesterol, and coronary CT angiography. "With further research, this could mean selectively scanning patients with high Lp(a) for their CAC score, and studying therapies specifically designed to reduce Lp(a) among patients with high CAC. Patients with both a high lipoprotein(a) and high coronary artery calcium score (CAC) face a more than 20% risk of heart attack or stroke over the following 10 years, according to findings from a multicenter study led by preventive cardiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Cardiology researchers confirmed the Lp(a) and CAC connection by comparing data from two landmark cardiovascular trials:
