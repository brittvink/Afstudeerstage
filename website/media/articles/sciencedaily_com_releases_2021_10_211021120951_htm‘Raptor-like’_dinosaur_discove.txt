Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.University of Queensland palaeontologist Dr Anthony Romilio recently led an international team to re-analyse the footprints, dated to the latter part of the Triassic Period, around 220 million-year-ago. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.For years it's been believed that these tracks were made by a massive theropod predator that was part of the dinosaur family Eubrontes, with legs over two metres tall," Dr Romilio said. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.This idea caused a sensation decades ago because no other meat-eating dinosaur in the world approached that size during the Triassic period. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.However, findings made by a team of international researchers, published today in the peer-reviewed journal Historical Biology, in fact shows the tracks were instead made by a dinosaur known as a Prosauropod - a vegetarian dinosaur that were smaller, with legs about 1.4 metres tall and a body length of six metres. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.The research team suspected there was something not-quite-right with the original size estimates and there was a good reason for their doubts. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.Unfortunately, most earlier researchers could not directly access the footprint specimen for their study, instead relying on old drawings and photographs that lacked detail," Dr Romilio said. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.The dinosaur fossils were discovered more than half a century ago around 200 metres deep underground at an Ipswich coal mine, just west of Brisbane. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.It must have been quite a sight for the first miners in the 1960s to see big bird-like footprints jutting down from the ceiling," Dr Romilio said. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.Hendrik Klein, co-author and fossil expert from Saurierwelt Pal√§ontologisches Museum in Germany, said the footprints -- referred to as 'Evazoum', scientifically, the footprint type made by prosauropod dinosaurs -- were made on the water-sodden layers of ancient plant debris with the tracks later in-filled by silt and sand. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.This explains why today they occur in an upside-down position right above our heads," Mr Klein said. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.After millions of years, the plant material turned into coal which was extracted by the miners to reveal a ceiling of siltstone and sandstone, complete with the natural casts of dinosaur footprints. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.The mine has long since closed, but fortunately, in 1964, geologists and the Queensland Museum mapped the trackway and made plaster casts, now used in current research. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.We made a virtual 3D model of the dinosaur footprint that was emailed to team members across the world to study," Mr Klein said. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.The more we looked at the footprint and toe impression shapes and proportions, the less they resembled tracks made by predatory dinosaurs -- this monster dinosaur was definitely a much friendlier plant-eater. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.This is still a significant discovery even if it isn't a scary Triassic carnivore. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.This is the earliest evidence we have for this type of dinosaur in Australia, marking a 50-million-year gap before the first quadrupedal sauropod fossils known. Fossil footprints found in an Australian coal mine around 50 years ago have long been thought to be that of a large 'raptor-like' predatory dinosaur, but scientists have in fact discovered they were instead left by a timid long-necked herbivore.The dinosaur footprint is on display at the Queensland Museum, Brisbane.
