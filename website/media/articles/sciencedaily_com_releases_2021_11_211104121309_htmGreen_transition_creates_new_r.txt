Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Green policies have traditionally been seen as costly to countries who implement them, while other nations can do nothing and "free-ride" -- leading to global inaction on the climate crisis. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.However, the research team -- led by the universities of Exeter, Cambridge, the Open University and Cambridge Econometrics -- say this is a "poor description" of today's reality. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Instead, they say the transition is already happening and, for many countries, embracing it is the best strategy to reduce costs. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.As the world economy transforms, free-riding may now be the risky approach -- not only environmentally but also economically. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.According to the new study, the risks and opportunities vary dramatically between countries, depending on their degree of competitiveness in fossil fuel markets. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Countries fall into one of three categories -- each with different incentives driven by the green transition. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Large fossil fuel importers like the EU and China will gain multiple benefits from decarbonising. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Meanwhile, "large competitive fossil fuel exporters" like Saudi Arabia may avoid economic decline by flooding global markets with cut-price fossil fuels. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The third category -- "large uncompetitive exporters" such as the US, Canada and Russia -- could suffer due to stranded fossil fuel assets and lack of investment in new technological sectors. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.However, the nations at the losing end can head off these impacts by diversifying their economies away from fossil fuels towards new technology sectors, including low-carbon exports. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The costs and benefits of decarbonisation and related politics have been misunderstood and misrepresented for some time," said Dr Jean-Francois Mercure, of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.In fact, the green transition is well under way, whether people realise it or not, and those politics are already at play. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Decarbonising is traditionally seen as expensive, but it really depends on how much high-carbon industry each country has to lose, versus how much can be gained in new technological sectors. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Professor Jorge Vi√±uales, of the University of Cambridge and co-author of the study, said: "The prevailing narrative that, while others decarbonise, you can free-ride them to your benefit must be turned on its head. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.As the economy transforms, if you do not decarbonise, you are shooting yourself in the foot. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The key question is how to do it in the specific conditions of your country. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The study says the rapid replacement of fossil fuels with renewables will cause a "profound reorganisation of industry value chains, international trade and geopolitics. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The researchers outline a structure of incentives that differ depending on countries' positions relative to the fossil fuel industry: Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The research suggests that unless this new geopolitical game is recognised and addressed, the world could become stuck in a deadlock in which some countries embrace the new technological wave, while others could become trapped in a vicious cycle of declining and obsolete fossil fuel-related industry, and ultimately, post-industrial decline. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The solution to industrial decline remains innovation in new sectors and economic diversification. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The disruptive nature of the low-carbon transition makes untenable a macroeconomic strategy based on 'business-as-usual'," said Dr Pablo Salas, from the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL). Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Supporting low-carbon innovation is the only way to maintain long-term competitiveness in a decarbonising economy. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.The researchers stress that they are not advocating particular climate policies, but merely identifying the new global geopolitical situation ahead of the vital COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Professor Neil Edwards, who led the UK Natural Environment Research Council-funded project from The Open University, which provided the climate modelling used for the work, said: "It remains a widely held belief that politicians have no motivation to enact the policies needed to protect the climate as laid out in the Paris Agreement. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Our paper clearly shows there are strong political incentives and furthermore that change is under way. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Commenting on the choices facing countries such as the US, Canada and Russia, Cambridge Econometrics Chief Economist Hector Pollitt said: "We are predicting a bleak outlook that is conditional to policy-makers, businesses and people in those countries not changing their strategic behaviour and decision-making. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.However, this bleak outlook can be turned around if they manage an orderly transition, support job creation in new sectors and facilitate the mobility of workers between the old and new industries. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Dr Gregor Semieniuk, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and another co-author on the study, said: "Developing countries face the largest challenges to insert themselves into the low-carbon technology supply chain. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Richer countries with high-cost fossil fuel supply but a diversified economy actually have the choice to participate fully in the low-carbon economy with appropriate industrial policy. They only have to manage to make that choice. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.Dr Mercure added: "Economic diversification away from fossil fuels is complex but necessary to protect economies from the volatility that usually occurs at the end of a technological era. We have to recognise that the end of the fossil fuel era is at our doorstep. Different countries face different risks and opportunities as the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy, researchers say.We hope our paper helps to explain the current situation, and encourages global cooperation on the issue of climate change, to promote economic development worldwide.
