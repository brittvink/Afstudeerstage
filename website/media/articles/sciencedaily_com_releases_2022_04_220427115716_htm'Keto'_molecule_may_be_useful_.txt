A molecule produced in the liver in response to low-carb "ketogenic" diets has a powerful effect in suppressing colorectal tumor growth and may be useful as a preventive and treatment of such cancers, according to a new study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.In the study, published in Nature, researchers initially found that mice on low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diets have a striking resistance to colorectal tumor development and growth. The scientists then traced this effect to beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a small organic molecule produced in the liver in response to keto diets or starvation.

The study's first author was Oxana Dmitrieva-Posocco, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Levy's lab.

Alcohol use, obesity, red meat, and low-fiber and high-sugar diets have all been linked to greater colorectal cancer risk. A molecule produced in the liver in response to low-carb "ketogenic" diets has a powerful effect in suppressing colorectal tumor growth and may be useful as a preventive and treatment of such cancers, according to a new study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.In the study, Levy, Thaiss and their teams set out to determine, with experiments in mice, whether different types of diet could inhibit colorectal cancer development and growth. They put six groups of mice on diets that had varying fat-to-carb ratios, and then used a standard chemical technique that normally induces colorectal tumors. A molecule produced in the liver in response to low-carb "ketogenic" diets has a powerful effect in suppressing colorectal tumor growth and may be useful as a preventive and treatment of such cancers, according to a new study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.They found that the two most ketogenic diets, with 90 percent fat-to-carb ratios -- one used lard (pig fat), the other Crisco (mostly soybean oil) -- prevented colorectal tumor development in most of the animals on those diets. By contrast, all the animals on the other diets, including low-fat, high-carb diets, developed tumors. Even when the researchers started the mice on these diets after colorectal tumors had started growing, the diets showed a "treatment effect" by markedly slowing further tumor growth and proliferation.

Ultimately, they traced this gut-cell growth slowdown to BHB -- normally produced by the liver as part of a "starvation response," and triggered in this case by the low-carb keto diets.

However, the researchers showed that it is not only a fuel source but also a potent growth-slowing signal, at least for gut-lining cells. They were able to reproduce the tumor-suppressing effects of the keto diets simply by giving the mice BHB, either in their water or via an infusion mimicking the liver's natural secretion of the molecule.

This in turn stimulates the expression of a growth-slowing gene, Hopx. A molecule produced in the liver in response to low-carb "ketogenic" diets has a powerful effect in suppressing colorectal tumor growth and may be useful as a preventive and treatment of such cancers, according to a new study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.Experiments with gut-lining cells from humans provided evidence that BHB has the same growth-slowing effect on these cells, via the human versions of Hcar2 and Hopx. Colorectal tumor cells that don't express these two genes were not responsive to BHB treatment, suggesting their utility as possible predictors of treatment efficiency.

They are also continuing to study BHB's potential anticancer effects in other parts of the body, and are investigating the effects of other molecules produced under ketogenic conditions.
