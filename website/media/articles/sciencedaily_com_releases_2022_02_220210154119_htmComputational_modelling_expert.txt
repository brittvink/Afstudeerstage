Mathematicians at the University of Leicester have developed a new mathematical model which could greatly increase the efficiency of pest control and hence significantly reduce the impact of pests on crops whilst minimising the damage to environment.A new study, published in Scientific Reports, builds upon individual-based model (IBM) techniques to explain and predict the formation of high slug density patches in arable fields. Mathematicians at the University of Leicester have developed a new mathematical model which could greatly increase the efficiency of pest control and hence significantly reduce the impact of pests on crops whilst minimising the damage to environment.While existing models built around the Turing theory of pattern formation (named for AI pioneer Alan Turing) and its generalisations are shown to work well for patterns in plant distribution, these are rarely able to accurately predict the distribution of animals due to the complexity of behavioural responses. Mathematicians at the University of Leicester have developed a new mathematical model which could greatly increase the efficiency of pest control and hence significantly reduce the impact of pests on crops whilst minimising the damage to environment.Drawing on field data collected in a three-year project, computational modelling experts in the University of Leicester's School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, alongside colleagues from The University of Birmingham and Harper Adams University, applied mathematical concepts to build a new model which shows trends of distribution, accounting for the movements of individual creatures. Mathematicians at the University of Leicester have developed a new mathematical model which could greatly increase the efficiency of pest control and hence significantly reduce the impact of pests on crops whilst minimising the damage to environment.Their model could be used in creating more efficient methods of pest control -- by targeting the use of pesticides and other techniques to protect crops -- and could be adapted to better understand the collective behaviour in other species, such as fish schools, bird flocks, and insect swarms. Mathematicians at the University of Leicester have developed a new mathematical model which could greatly increase the efficiency of pest control and hence significantly reduce the impact of pests on crops whilst minimising the damage to environment.Sergei Petrovskii is a Professor in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leicester and lead author for the study.

Using unique field techniques specifically developed to support modelling and simulations allowed progress that would hardly be possible with empirical tools alone.
