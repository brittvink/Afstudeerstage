Geographers from Staffordshire University are stepping into the virtual world of computer games to develop exciting new ways of assessing landscapes.Ruth Swetnam, Professor of Applied Geography, has spent years analysing geographical landscapes and determining what features people from different countries find most appealing. Geographers from Staffordshire University are stepping into the virtual world of computer games to develop exciting new ways of assessing landscapes.This has included work on a major project for the Welsh Government to evaluate the impact of their agri-environmental scheme Glastir on rural landscapes. In this collaborative Â£6 million programme coordinated by UKCEH Ruth led the landscape team and their findings have helped to shape government policy in Wales.

More than two thousand responses were collected using a photographic survey. However, participants aged 25 and under were significantly underrepresented in the self-selecting sample.

Of those who had visited rural Wales before, 64% gave a rating of at least 7 out of 10 for its representativeness.

There were no significant differences in overall ratings between the two groups which indicates that being familiar with gaming would not preclude the use of similar landscape visualisations in public consultation exercises.

Key to success is an interdisciplinary approach, combining the technical flair of the visual effects experts with the geographical grounding provided by the landscape scientist.

Young voices are essential to capture in this debate as they are the generation who will be living with these new landscape futures.
