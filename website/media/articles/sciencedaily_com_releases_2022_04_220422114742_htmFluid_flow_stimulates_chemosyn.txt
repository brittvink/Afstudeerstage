Most visitors to Paliochori Beach on the Greek island Milos may not be aware of the bay's shallow-water hydrothermal community, a veritable Greek salad of microbes, that is within snorkeling distance from the shoreline.The hydrothermalism in the coastal sediments of Paliochori Bay strongly affects biogeochemical processes there and supports chemosynthesis, which allows certain microorganisms such as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria to use chemical energy rather than light, as photosynthetic plants or algae do, to convert carbon dioxide into cell material. Most visitors to Paliochori Beach on the Greek island Milos may not be aware of the bay's shallow-water hydrothermal community, a veritable Greek salad of microbes, that is within snorkeling distance from the shoreline.However, the impact of fluid flow on the composition of the microbial community and the rates of chemosynthetic production have been unknown because it is challenging to measure microbial processes under natural conditions, particularly in hydrothermal systems. Most visitors to Paliochori Beach on the Greek island Milos may not be aware of the bay's shallow-water hydrothermal community, a veritable Greek salad of microbes, that is within snorkeling distance from the shoreline.A new study uses an innovative approach to examine the bay's shallow-water hydrothermal system and the production of microbes there in situ and near natural conditions as a model to assess the importance of hydrothermal fluid circulation on chemosynthesis.

The study deployed incubation devices along a transect at a vent in the bay and injected the tracer at different depths into the sediment, either in open or closed fluid flow modes, and left the devices in place for either 6 hours or 24 hours before picking them up again.

The researchers' data reveal that active fluid flow at this sandy sediment shallow-water hydrothermal vent site sustains carbon fixation rates that are among the highest determined for coastal margin sediments, highlighting the influence of hydrothermalism in supporting chemoautotrophic production by supplying the required chemicals in the form of electron donors such as hydrogen sulfide, and acceptors such as oxygen.

"That is about the same annual production per area as a 4-acre corn field," says Sievert.

The chemosynthetic production at Milos is mainly driven by Campylobacteria, which dominated the communities in the open incubations, but declined in the closed incubations. Other bacteria, in particular Gammaproteobacteria, also increased in open flow incubations, while others, such as Deltaproteobacteria and Thermodesulfobacteria increased in closed incubations. In general, the community switched from a community dominated by chemosynthetic microbes to one with a higher proportion of heterotrophic microbes, i.e., microbes that use organic carbon for food, just as people do. The study found that the microbial community changed in response to different conditions within a matter of hours, which is very fast and took the investigators by surprise.

That collaboration included Sievert's expertise in the use of the incubation device and identifying the microbes based on DNA- and RNA-based techniques. In addition, the lab of co-lead author Solveig BÃ¼hring, a researcher at the University of Bremen, contributed data on the incorporation of the labelled carbon dioxide into the microbes' fatty acids.

I'm interested in knowing what the microbes are doing and how they are helping the ecosystem to function," says Sievert.

"Microbes are kind of the engines of our planet, basically driving all of the biogeochemical cycles, such as the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.
