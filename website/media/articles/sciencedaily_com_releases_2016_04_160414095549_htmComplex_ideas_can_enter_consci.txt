It's difficult to look at pictures of cars shown on a computer and then keep yourself from saying "car" inside your head the next time one shows up on the screen -- even when someone tells you to avoid saying it. Now, a new study led by San Francisco State University researcher Ezequiel Morsella concludes that this same automatic effect can occur with much more complicated mental manipulations -- for instance, transforming "car" to the pig latin "ar-cay" in your head after you've been told to avoid that transformation.This surprising effect offers further evidence that the contents of our consciousness -- the state of being awake and aware of our surroundings -- are often generated involuntarily, said Morsella, an assistant professor of psychology. In fact, the study published in the journal Acta Psychologica provides the first demonstration that even a small amount of training can cause unintentional, high-level symbol manipulation.

"Our study reveals that unintentional, unconscious processes can be more sophisticated than what has been thought before.

Now, a new study led by San Francisco State University researcher Ezequiel Morsella concludes that this same automatic effect can occur with much more complicated mental manipulations -- for instance, transforming "car" to the pig latin "ar-cay" in your head after you've been told to avoid that transformation.In the study, 32 SF State students were taught or reminded how to rearrange words in pig latin (removing the first letter of a word and adding it in front of "ay" at the end of the word). They were then told to not perform this transformation in their heads when prompted with another set of words -- but to press the spacebar during the computerized test if they did perform the transformation unintentionally.

The theory has generated a significant amount of attention in academic circles and in the popular media, and Morsella said his team has written a follow-up paper to the study that will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences.

But [consciousness] is necessary," he stressed.

"If you're arguing with someone over the internet, you need the internet," but it isn't doing any of the arguing or resolving the argument.

"What my lab is showing is that, in some cases, you're better off, through some form of re-training, not letting that urge enter consciousness in the first place, because once that urge enters consciousness, it's in a late stage of processing, and it's already very strong.
