Heavy drinkers and users of illegal drugs downplay their relative levels of consumption, when comparing themselves to others, reveals research by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.Published in the journal Social Science and Medicine, the research shows that 68 per cent of respondents to the Global Drugs Survey (GDS) -- the world's biggest drug survey -- were drinking at hazardous or harmful levels, yet the vast majority (83 per cent) felt they were drinking at low or average levels.

Although frequent and/or heavier users were more likely to judge their use to be above average than moderate users they still tended to downplay their levels of use. For example, the survey showed that using cannabis every day or most days was fairly unusual yet a third or more of respondents who used cannabis this frequently considered their use to be average (33 per cent) or less than average (42 per cent).

Thirty six per cent wanted to drink less alcohol and 25 per cent wanted to reduce their use of illicit drugs -- mainly cannabis and cocaine.

Heavier users, and those who saw themselves as such, were more likely to want to reduce their consumption than those who used less or thought they did. Heavy drinkers and users of illegal drugs downplay their relative levels of consumption, when comparing themselves to others, reveals research by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.Regardless of respondents actual drinking habits, those who thought they were drinking at a high rate compared to others were almost twice as likely to want to cut down as those who thought they were drinking at average levels. Similar effects were evident in relation to cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.

With this in mind we've created an app where people can confidentially input their use and it will give them a true picture of how their use compares to others. We hope that for some people this might provide the jolt they need to address their excessive alcohol or drug use.
