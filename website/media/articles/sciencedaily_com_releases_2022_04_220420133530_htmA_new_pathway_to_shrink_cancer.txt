Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.The researchers say this discovery is significant as many solid tumor cancers like lung cancer are difficult to treat. According to the National Cancer Institute, breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancers -- which are all solid tumor cancers-account for almost half of all new cancer cases in the United States. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.In this new research, the scientists discovered that altering the macrophage metabolism -- and in doing so influence their relationship with T cells -- suppressed the tumor's growth. The result was a significant reduction in overall tumor size in some mouse models. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.The race to find a cure for cancer never stops," said Stanley Huang, an assistant professor of immunology in the Department of Pathology at the School of Medicine, who led the research. "Our research creates a pathway to a [potential] new form of cancer treatment for those with solid tumor cancers. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.The study appeared recently in the journal, Nature Immunology. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.T cells and macrophages Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Generally, the body's immune response to disease involves mobilizing white blood cells that attack invaders like germs and bacteria. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Macrophages are specialized white blood cells that consume invading cells to destroy pathogens. They are considered the "frontline soldiers" of the body's immune system and can activate T cells, which are another type of white blood cell. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Yet, despite their typically protective role, macrophages can be co-opted by tumor cells to encourage tumor growth. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Targeting macrophages and PERK protein Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.As tumors grow and macrophages interact with the tumor cells, they create a response protein, which the study linked to tumor growth. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Huang said the team believed it was possible to target macrophages and that protein -- known to scientists by its shorthand, PERK ("protein kinase R" (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) to block tumor growth. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Knocking out PERK suppresses downstream metabolic signaling in tumor macrophages, resulting in more T cells to fight the cancer cells," said Huang. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Findings and future steps Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.The study's findings suggest that the PERK protein is involved in several key pathways of metabolism in macrophages -- and when the gene is removed, macrophages can no longer promote tumor growth; meaning tumors become smaller. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Follow-up experiments further revealed that combination treatment of a PERK inhibitor drug with an inhibitor called "anti-PD-1" could significantly reduce tumor growth. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.Next, the researchers hope to identify a clinical drug that will act as an inhibitor for the PERK protein. Cancer researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine say they have successfully suppressed the growth of some solid tumors in research models by manipulating immune cells known as a macrophages.There are several strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity like targeting or editing cell metabolism," Huang said. "We can target genes and their pathways to enhance immune function and work toward future therapeutic treatment options.
