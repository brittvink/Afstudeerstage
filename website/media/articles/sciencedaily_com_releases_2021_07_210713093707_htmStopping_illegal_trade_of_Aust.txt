Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.In a new study in Animal Conservation, researchers from the University of Adelaide and the Monitor Conservation Research Society (Monitor) investigated the extent of illegal trade in a well-known Australian lizard: the shingleback, also known as the bobtail or sleepy lizard.

Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.While under Australian law it is illegal to export native live species, the import to many countries is not, along with trade once the animals have entered the country. It is left to each importing country to address the issue on an individual basis, such as changing their legislation to regulate both the trade and import of species native to other countries.

This includes the threatened Tiliqua rugosa konowi subspecies, only found in the wild on Rottnest Island, Western Australia.

Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.They don't tend to travel far from where they live and their defences, which include a slow retreat when approached and opening their mouth and sticking their tongue out, are not all that daunting. So they can be easily captured even by unskilled people," Mr Toomes said. Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.Examining seizure data from 2015 to 2018 from the Australian Government's Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment, and additional seizure data from 2009 to 2020, the study shows more than 260 shinglebacks were destined for illegal exportation to countries including Hong Kong, China, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sweden.

Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.To protect Australian shinglebacks and curtail global trade, the researchers recommend they be listed in Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which provides other countries with the legal means to confiscate illegally exported species. Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.CITES Appendix III lists species that are protected in their native country for which the country has requested assistance from others to regulate trade. New species can be added to the lists by notifying the CITES secretariat.

Australian reptiles face serious conservation threats from illegal poaching fueled by international demand and the exotic pet trade.While stronger international regulations and improved legislation are urgently needed to curb the illegal wildlife trade globally, until such legislation exists, CITES Appendix III is a legal tool that can help us protect at-risk native species, like the shingleback, right away.
