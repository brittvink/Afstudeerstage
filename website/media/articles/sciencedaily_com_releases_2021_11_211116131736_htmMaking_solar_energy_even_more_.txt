Technology using a new generation of hybrid solar cells is one step closer to mass-production, thanks to Newcastle University-led research.An international team of scientists have identified a new process using coordination materials that can accelerate the use of low-cost, Earth-abundant materials with the potential to transform the energy sector by replacing silicone-based solar panels. Technology using a new generation of hybrid solar cells is one step closer to mass-production, thanks to Newcastle University-led research.Publishing their results in the journal Chem, the team, led by Newcastle University and colleagues from Uppsala University in Sweden and University of Naples Federico II, Italy, developed dynamic dimeric copper complexes using tetradentate ligands (the ligands that bind four donor atoms). These new copper systems offer a novel combination of fast charge transport in an unprecedented two-electron redox mechanism while inhibiting carrier recombination after disproportionation.

It can help power photovoltaic devices with minimal voltage losses, with comparably low reorganization energies and recombination rates.
