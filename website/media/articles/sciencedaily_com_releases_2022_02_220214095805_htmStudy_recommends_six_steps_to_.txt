Since nitrogen persists for so long, management efforts may seem futile and unattractive because it can take a long time to see results. The study from the University of Waterloo appearing in Nature Geoscience provides a roadmap for scientists, policymakers, and the public to overcome the challenges associated with this legacy nitrogen for faster improvements to our water quality. We have to think about the legacy we leave for the future in a strategic way from both the scientific and socio-economic angles," said Nandita Basu, a professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Civil and Environmental Engineering at Waterloo and the study's lead author. "This is a call to action for us to accept that these legacies exist and figure out how to use them to our advantage. The study recommends the following six steps: Nitrogen legacies are different around the world depending on the climate and historical land use, and land management patterns. While theoretical knowledge of these legacies has existed for decades, measurements and monitoring have not yet been widespread enough to understand these differences and support water quality policies, where there is still an expectation of short-term water quality improvement. It's time we stop treating nitrogen legacies as the elephant in the room and design watershed management strategies that can address these past legacies," said Basu. "We need to ask ourselves how we can do better for the future.
