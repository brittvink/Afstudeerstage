Some of the same brain systems known to play a role in learning from trial and error also are engaged when people conform to social norms, scientists report in a new study. The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The study is reported in the journal Psychophysiology.

"We see that our drive to conform is a pivotal piece of our psychology, with close links to the important brain systems that support learning. Some of the same brain systems known to play a role in learning from trial and error also are engaged when people conform to social norms, scientists report in a new study. The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The researchers set out to better understand how the brain navigates social situations. To do so, they had participants play a modified version of the "ultimatum game," in which one player proposes how to split $10 with another. The other player, a responder, can either accept or reject the proposer's offer. If a responder rejects the proposed split, neither party gets any money.

"But people don't generally behave that way. If they feel an offer is unfair, they're more likely to reject it, to punish unfair partners even though this comes at their own expense.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The participants alternated between serving as proposers and responders. Throughout the experiment, participants interacted with a computer but thought they were dealing with other people.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The researchers wanted to find the links between how people reacted when their partners accepted or rejected their offers and how their behavior changed after observing the offers as responders.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.Our behavior is â€¦ shaped indirectly by observing the actions of our peers, which oftentimes trigger drives to conform and imitate their behavior," the authors wrote. "A key question is how the neurocognitive systems associated with processing other people's actions overlap with the machinery dedicated to directly learning from rewards and losses.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The team used electroencephalograms to track electrical activity in participants' brains as they played the game. EEGs capture brain responses within hundreds of milliseconds after a stimulus. They also point to brain regions involved in those responses.

"And we found that the drive to conform was linked to the same EEG patterns as changing one's behavior following acceptances or rejections.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.These results demonstrate that the same brain system guides both pathways to behavior change," Bogdan said. "This indicates that people learn from social information similarly to how they learn on their own from trial and error.

The findings are important, the researchers said, because changing one's behavior to align with one's peers can contribute to community-building or -- depending on the goals and values of the group -- societal breakdown.The study suggests that understanding how someone sees the world "requires considering the people they associate with," Bogdan said. "More often than not, these will be their guides to right versus wrong.
