Nikhil C. Munshi, M.D., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, and coauthors examined medical literature in a meta-analysis. Their results suggest that a negative minimal residual disease status after treatment appears to be associated with improved survival. The authors suggest minimal residual disease status may be a marker of long-term survival outcome and the assessment of minimal residual disease status after treatment should be considered as an end-point in clinical trials.
