The second M-class flare was also a long-duration flare, and it peaked on June 14, 2012 at 10:08 AM EDT. The CME associated with this flare is traveling much faster -- preliminary analysis at Goddard's Space Weather Center indicates it is traveling at speeds of approximately 800 miles per second. It is traveling toward Earth, and could also impact Mars and the Spitzer spacecraft. The Space Weather Center models estimate that both CMEs will arrive on June 16. NASA will provide updates if AR1504 generates additional space weather. What is a prominence? What is a solar flare? What is a coronal mass ejection?
