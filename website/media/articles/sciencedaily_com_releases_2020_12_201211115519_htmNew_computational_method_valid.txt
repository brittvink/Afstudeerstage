A realtor sends a prospective homebuyer a blurry photograph of a house taken from across the street. The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.What if you aren't looking at a picture of a house, but something very small -- like a protein? There is no way to see it without a specialized device so there's nothing to judge the image against, no "ground truth," as it's called. There isn't much to do but trust that the imaging equipment and the computer model used to create images are accurate.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.Now, however, research from the lab of Matthew Lew at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis has developed a computational method to determine how much confidence a scientist should have that their measurements, at any given point, are accurate, given the model used to produce them.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.The research was published Dec. 11 in Nature Communications.

Green Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering. It's not simply a way to get a sharper picture. "This is a whole new way of validating the trustworthiness of each detail within a scientific image.

"It's saying, 'This part of the image might be wrong or misplaced.' A realtor sends a prospective homebuyer a blurry photograph of a house taken from across the street. The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.The process used by scientists to "see" the very small -- single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) -- relies on capturing massive amounts of information from the object being imaged. That information is then interpreted by a computer model that ultimately strips away most of the data, reconstructing an ostensibly accurate image -- a true picture of a biological structure, like an amyloid protein or a cell membrane.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.There are a few methods already in use to help determine whether an image is, generally speaking, a good representation of the thing being imaged. These methods, however, cannot determine how likely it is that any single data point within an image is accurate.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.Hesam Mazidi, a recent graduate who was a PhD student in Lew's lab for this research, tackled the problem.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.We wanted to see if there was a way we could do something about this scenario without ground truth," he said. "If we could use modeling and algorithmic analysis to quantify if our measurements are faithful, or accurate enough.

The homebuyer can compare it to the real thing -- look at the picture, then look at the real house -- and see that the bay window is actually two windows close together, the flowers out front are plastic and what looked like a door is actually a hole in the wall.The researchers didn't have ground truth -- no house to compare to the realtor's picture -- but they weren't empty handed. They had a trove of data that is usually ignored. Mazidi took advantage of the massive amount of information gathered by the imaging device that usually gets discarded as noise. The distribution of noise is something the researchers can use as ground truth because it conforms to specific laws of physics.

All of the data points recorded by the imaging device. "There is real data there that people throw away and ignore.

The closer to one, the more confident a scientist can be that a point on an image is, in fact, accurately representing the thing being imaged.

"If you can quantify performance, then you can also improve your model by using the score," Mazidi said. Without access to ground truth, "it allows us to evaluate performance under real experimental conditions rather than a simulation.

Lew said the next step is to use it to validate machine learning, where biased datasets may produce inaccurate outputs.

"Using this model, you'd be able to test on data that has no ground truth, where you don't know if the neural network was trained with data that are similar to real-world data.

"Sometimes we just want to push the big red button and see what we get, but we have to remember, there's a lot that happens when you push that button.
