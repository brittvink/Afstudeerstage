Once bluebanded gobies become fathers, they stay close to the developing eggs, vigorously fan and rub them until they hatch, and also protect them from mothers who would eat them. By injecting a series of chemicals into the brains of these fathers, the research team temporarily altered their brain androgens and also their level of parental care. As a result, the researchers found that brain androgens actually promote good parenting.
