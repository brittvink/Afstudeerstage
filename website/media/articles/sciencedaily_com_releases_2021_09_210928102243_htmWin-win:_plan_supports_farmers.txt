A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsThe team said its proposal would cost 0.1 per cent of GDP each year, restore habitat and meet one-sixth of Australia's Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Climate Agreement. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsUQ PhD candidate Bonnie Mappin said the incentivised program would also put cash into the hands of willing farmers via stewardship payments. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsThis plan is a win-win for the environment and rural communities," Ms Mappin said. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsWe've outlined a pathway to achieve 30 per cent native vegetation coverage of almost all of Australia's degraded terrestrial ecosystems on marginal farming land. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsMarginal land is ripe for revegetation. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsFarmers could continue to produce valuable crops on prime land, while rebuilding our environment and sequestering carbon. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsMs Mappin said the plan's carbon pricing scenario -- which fits current trends -- would ensure the program would pay for itself. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsWe estimate that this restoration would cost approximately AU$2 billion annually over 30 years, or a net present value of $41 billion for the life of the project," she said. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsThe cost would be offset by the expected carbon revenue of AU$12 to $46 billion. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsWe estimate this would achieve 16 per cent of the greenhouse gas emission reduction of Australia's Nationally Determined Contributions by 2030 for commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsCo-Author Professor Lesley Hughes, a founding Councillor with the Climate Council of Australia and a Director for WWF Australia, said the plan was critical, given that the health and diversity of Australian ecosystems are in decline. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsOur environment is under mounting pressure from land clearing, altered fire regimes and invasive species," Professor Hughes said. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsAustralian ecosystems are also extremely vulnerable to climate impacts with extreme temperatures and fires expected to become more frequent and more severe. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsAustralia's environmental legislation and policies have failed to tackle these mounting issues and there is a lack of adequate funding for environmental management, threatened species protection and ecological restoration. A national plan to restore habitat on marginal farming land would fight climate change, prevent species loss and put money in farmers' pockets, according to a team of University of Queensland-led scientistsRestoration of native vegetation on marginal lands has enormous co-benefits for Australian biodiversity by improving habitat and the ecosystem services our species provide, and supporting jobs, especially in rural and regional communities.
