A culture of silence around the issues of menstruation needs to be broken," said Marni Sommer, DrPH, MSN, RN, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. "Menstrual equity is a human rights and public health issue, with racial, socioeconomic, and sex disparities intertwined," said co-author Diana J. Mason, PhD, RN, senior policy service professor at the Center for Health Policy and Media Engagement, George Washington University School of Nursing. Evidence from low as well as high resource countries shows that significant menstruation-related challenges are faced by schoolgirls, displaced adolescent girls and women, as well as women in the workplace, and many of these disparities intensified during the pandemic. Additional data highlight how those affected by homelessness face issues that go beyond access to products, and how they encounter barriers to manage their periods with dignity. At a minimum, access to free menstrual products in all public spaces is needed, as Scotland has done. In addition, attention is essential to assure all people with periods have access to safe, private spaces with water and soap for changing their menstrual products in comfort," noted Sommer. To promote menstrual equity Sommer and Mason make the following points: Women, adolescent girls, and all people with periods in the U.S. and around the world must be able to manage their periods with dignity and comfort, without stigma or shame," said Mason.
