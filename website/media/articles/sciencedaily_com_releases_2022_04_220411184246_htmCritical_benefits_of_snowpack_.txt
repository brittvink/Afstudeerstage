University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.Warming winters may sound like a welcome change for some farmers because the change in temperature could reduce freezing stress on plants and create more ideal conditions for growing overwinter cash crops and winter cover crops. However, when looking at climate change from a cross-seasonal perspective and accounting for declining snowpack, researchers are finding that the whole picture isn't so sunny. University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.Reduced snow may result in more exposure of winter crops to freeze and could mean greater risks for agricultural drought. University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.In a new study published in Nature Climate Change, Zhenong Jin, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering at the University of Minnesota, led an international team in researching the implications that could be associated with warmer winters and declining snowpack, using winter wheat (the largest winter crop in the U.S.) as an example.

There might be risks for being overoptimistic about growing overwinter crops under climate change," said Jin. University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.Researchers used panel regression, a powerful statistical method to analyze repeated observations over time, to attribute the interannual variability of winter wheat yield to multiple interactive environmental factors. These factors included cold season freezing degree days, growing degree days, rainfall and snowfall during the growing season and snow cover fraction during frozen days.

University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.This research will help inform breeders as they consider the complex tradeoffs among warming, reduced snowpack and occasional freezing threats when developing climate-smart cultivars. University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.These results also highlight the necessity of improving the representation of snow associated processes in crop models to better evaluate climate change effects and adaptation potential in cropping systems. University of Minnesota scientists are partnering with a global team to study the complex effects of climate change on winter crops.It is worth noting that in some cropping systems freezing stress is appreciated, since it helps farmers control pests and diseases and snow is even removed or at least made more compact by farmers to increase the freezing of the soil," said Jin. "When data becomes available, future studies might also need to account for the influence of snow on pests and diseases to comprehensively understand what future changes in snowpack mean for the cropping system.
