We tend to be economically irrational when it comes to choosing how we use resources like money and time but scarcity can convert us into economically rational decision makers, according to research in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.Research from psychological science has shown that we humans make economically irrational decisions all the time, influenced by contextual factors that have no bearing on the utility or pleasure we will derive from a good or a service. We may scoff at the idea of buying a $4 hot dog from a street vendor, for example, but have no qualms about getting a $7 hot dog at a baseball game. The quality of the hot dog is about the same in both scenarios but the context isn't, and that makes all the difference.

After all, paying for one thing means we can't pay for something else.

And these trade-offs do not depend on where the beer is purchased," the researchers explain.

Specifically, high-income participants were willing to pay more for a beer from a "fancy resort hotel" than for the same beer from a "small, run-down grocery store," but the amount lower-income participants were willing to pay didn't vary according to where the beer was purchased.

Lower-income participants, however, were less sensitive to the proportional size of the discount.

These findings suggest that a condition of scarcity -- such as being on a diet or feeling time-pressured -- disposes people to think more consistently about the value of the resource in question, regardless of other contextual factors.

But recent research highlights the boundaries of such interventions," Shah and colleagues note.
