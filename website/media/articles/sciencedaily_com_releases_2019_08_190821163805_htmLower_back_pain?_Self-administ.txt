A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Murphy says that while acupressure has been previously studied -- and found to be beneficial -- in people with cancer-related or osteoarthritis pain, there are few studies that have examined acupressure in people with back pain. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.In the study, published in Pain Medicine, the research team randomly assigned 67 participants with chronic low back pain into three groups: relaxing acupressure, stimulating acupressure or usual care. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Relaxing acupressure is thought to be effective in reducing insomnia, while stimulating acupressure is thought to be effective in fatigue reduction," Murphy says. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Participants in the acupressure groups were trained to administer acupressure on certain points of the body, and spent between 27 and 30 minutes daily, over the course of six weeks, performing the technique. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Participants in the usual care group were asked to continue whatever treatments they were currently receiving from their care providers to manage their back pain and fatigue. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Compared to the usual care group, we found that people who performed stimulating acupressure experienced pain and fatigue improvement and those that performed relaxing acupressure felt their pain had improved after six weeks," Murphy says. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.We found no differences among the groups in terms of sleep quality or disability after the six weeks. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Potential treatment option A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Murphy notes that chronic pain is difficult to manage and people with the condition tend to have additional symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and depression.

A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.Although larger studies are needed, acupressure may be a useful pain management strategy given that it is low risk, low cost and easy to administer," Murphy says. A recent study finds that acupressure, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, can improve chronic pain symptoms in the lower back.We also recommend additional studies into the different types of acupressure and how they could more specifically be targeted to patients based on their symptoms.
